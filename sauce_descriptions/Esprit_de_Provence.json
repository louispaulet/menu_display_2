{"name":"Esprit de Provence","bottling_date":"2023-10-14","hotness_level":6,"description":"Esprit de Provence is a unique hot sauce that captures the essence of Southern France. Infusing French elegance and culinary traditions, it features a delicate blend of ripe cayenne peppers with the floral notes of lavender and a hint of rosemary. The mild heat allows the subtle flavors of garlic and shallots, slow-roasted in extra virgin olive oil, to shine through. A pinch of Fleur de Sel de Camargue adds a touch of gourmet finish to this sophisticated sauce. Perfect for drizzling over grilled meats, jazzing up ratatouille, or simply enjoying with a crusty baguette."}
