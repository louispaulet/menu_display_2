## Instructions

### Choux Pastry:
1. Preheat your oven to 190째C (375째F) and line two baking trays with parchment paper.
2. In a medium saucepan, combine water, milk, butter, sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat.
3. Remove from heat, add the flour in one go, and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together and forms a ball.
4. Return the saucepan to low heat and continue stirring for 1-2 minutes to dry the dough.
5. Transfer dough to a mixer bowl. Let cool slightly before adding eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition, until the dough is smooth and glossy.
6. Transfer dough to a piping bag fitted with a plain round tip.
7. Pipe small mounds onto prepared baking trays. Use a wet finger to smooth tops if necessary.
8. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and firm. Let cool completely.

### Raspberry Cream:
1. In a small saucepan, cook raspberries and sugar over low heat until raspberries break down.
2. Strain through a sieve to remove seeds.
3. Sprinkle gelatin over 1 tbsp of cold water and let it bloom for 5 minutes.
4. Heat the raspberry puree gently and dissolve the gelatin into the warm puree, then cool.
5. Whip the cream to soft peaks and fold it into the raspberry puree gently.

### Pistachio Mousseline:
1. In a saucepan, heat milk and vanilla bean until almost boiling.
2. In a bowl, whisk sugar, egg yolks, cornstarch until pale thick.
3. Slowly pour hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly.
4. Return mixture to saucepan, and cook over medium heat until thick and bubbly.
5. Remove from heat, cover with plastic directly on surface to prevent skin, and cool completely.
6. Beat butter until creamy, then add pistachio paste.
7. Fold into the cooled custard until smooth.

### Assembly:
1. Slice the tops off choux pastry puffs and fill the bottom halves with raspberry cream and pistachio mousseline layers.
2. Place the tops back on and dust with powdered sugar.
3. Garnish with crushed pistachios and extra raspberries.
