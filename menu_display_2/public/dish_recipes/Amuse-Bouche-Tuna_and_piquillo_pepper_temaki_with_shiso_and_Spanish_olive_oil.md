## Course
Amuse-Bouche

## Description
A delightful bite-sized handroll showcasing fresh tuna and piquillo peppers, augmented by the herbaceous notes of shiso and the rich texture of Spanish olive oil. This elegant dish is perfectly paired with the vibrant effervescence of Cava Recaredo Brut Nature Gran Reserva 2015.

## Ingredients

### For the Tuna Temaki
- **200g sashimi-grade tuna**, finely diced
- **8 piquillo peppers**, finely chopped
- **4 large shiso leaves**, finely sliced
- **1 tablespoon Spanish extra virgin olive oil**
- **1 teaspoon soy sauce**
- **1 teaspoon yuzu juice**
- **1 small avocado**, thinly sliced
- **4 sheets nori (seaweed)**, halved
- **Freshly ground black pepper**, to taste

### For Garnish
- **Microgreens**
- **Sesame seeds**

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Tuna Filling**: In a medium bowl, combine the diced tuna, chopped piquillo peppers, sliced shiso leaves, Spanish olive oil, soy sauce, yuzu juice, and freshly ground black pepper. Gently mix to ensure all ingredients are evenly coated. Set aside and refrigerate until ready to use.

2. **Prepare the Nori**: Using kitchen scissors, cut each nori sheet into two equal halves. Toast them lightly over an open flame or in the oven (optional) to enhance crispness.

3. **Assemble the Temaki**: Place one halved sheet of nori on a clean surface, shiny side down. Spread a thin layer of tuna mixture diagonally across the nori, leaving one corner empty. Add a slice or two of avocado alongside the tuna mixture.

4. **Roll the Temaki**: Starting from the filled corner, gently roll the nori into a cone shape, sealing the edge with a small dab of water if necessary.

5. **Garnish and Serve**: Arrange the temaki on a serving platter. Garnish with microgreens and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.

6. **Wine Pairing**: Serve immediately with a glass of chilled Cava Recaredo Brut Nature Gran Reserva 2015 to complement the dish with its citrusy and mineral notes.

## Chef's Tips
- Ensure the tuna is of the highest sashimi-grade quality as it's the star of the dish.
- If you prefer a spicier kick, add a hint of wasabi paste to the tuna mixture.
- The yuzu juice can be replaced with lemon juice, although yuzu provides a unique aroma and flavor.
