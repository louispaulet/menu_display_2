### Squid Ink Tagliolini with Lobster, Cherry Tomatoes, and Basil

#### Ingredients:

**For the Squid Ink Tagliolini:**
- 200g all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tbsp squid ink
- 1/2 tsp salt

**For the Lobster Sauce:**
- 2 whole live lobsters (about 1.5 lbs each)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 200g cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- Fresh basil leaves, for garnish
- Salt and pepper, to taste

#### Instructions:

##### Making the Squid Ink Tagliolini:
1. **Prepare the Dough:**
   - On a clean surface, form a mound with the flour and make a well in the center. Crack the eggs into the well, add the squid ink and salt.
   - Gradually mix the flour into the eggs using a fork, starting from the inner rim of the well.
   - Once combined, knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
   - Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

2. **Roll and Cut the Pasta:**
   - After resting, roll the dough out on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Use a pasta machine if available.
   - Cut into thin strips with a sharp knife to form tagliolini. Lightly flour the pasta to prevent it from sticking together, and set aside.

##### Preparing the Lobster:
3. **Cook the Lobster:**
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Plunge the lobsters into the boiling water and cook for 8-10 minutes until they turn bright red.
   - Remove and let cool slightly before extracting the meat from the tail and claws. Chop into bite-sized pieces.

##### Making the Sauce:
4. **Sauté the Sauce Ingredients:**
   - In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté until fragrant.
   - Add cherry tomatoes and cook until they begin to blister, about 5 minutes.

5. **Combine and Finish:**
   - Pour in the white wine and allow it to reduce by half, stirring occasionally.
   - Add the lobster meat to the skillet and continue to cook until heated through.
   - Stir in the butter for a rich, silky finish. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

##### Cooking the Tagliolini:
6. **Cook the Pasta:**
   - In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. Cook the squid ink tagliolini for 3-4 minutes until al dente.
   - Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of pasta water.

7. **Combine with Sauce:**
   - Add the cooked tagliolini to the lobster sauce, tossing gently to combine.
   - If needed, add a splash of reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce.

##### Serving:
8. **Plate the Dish:**
   - Divide the pasta and lobster mixture among serving plates.
   - Garnish with fresh basil leaves and serve immediately.
