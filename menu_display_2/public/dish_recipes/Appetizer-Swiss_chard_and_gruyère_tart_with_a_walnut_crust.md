# Swiss Chard and Gruyère Tart with a Walnut Crust

## Ingredients

### For the Walnut Crust
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup finely ground walnuts
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup chilled unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
- 3-4 tablespoons ice water

### For the Filling
- 1 large bunch Swiss chard, stems removed and leaves roughly chopped
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup grated Gruyère cheese
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Crust:**
    - In a large bowl, combine the flour, ground walnuts, salt, and pepper.
    - Add the chilled butter and work it into the flour using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
    - Gradually add the ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough begins to come together.
    - Form the dough into a disc, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

2. **Blind Bake the Crust:**
    - Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
    - Roll out the dough on a floured surface to fit a 9-inch tart pan. Place the rolled dough into the pan, pressing gently into the edges and trimming excess.
    - Line the crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the weights and parchment, and bake for an additional 5-7 minutes or until light golden.
    - Set aside to cool.

3. **Prepare the Filling:**
    - Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
    - Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
    - Stir in the garlic and Swiss chard; season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the chard is wilted and most of the moisture has evaporated.
    - Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.

4. **Assemble the Tart:**
    - In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, Gruyère cheese, nutmeg, and thyme.
    - Spread the chard mixture evenly over the bottom of the cooled crust.
    - Pour the egg and cream mixture over the top, gently spreading to cover the greens.

5. **Bake the Tart:**
    - Place the tart in the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the filling is set and the top is golden and slightly puffed.
    - Allow the tart to cool slightly before slicing.

6. **Serve:**
    - Serve warm with a glass of Fendant Clos de la Morge Domaine Rouvinez 2019, which enhances the nutty and creamy flavors of the tart with its fresh and mineral notes.
