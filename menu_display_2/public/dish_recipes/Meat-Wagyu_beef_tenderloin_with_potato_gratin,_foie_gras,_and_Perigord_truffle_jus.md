- 1 cup beef stock
- 2 teaspoons truffle oil
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

#### Instructions:

**1. Prepare the Potato Gratin:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Butter a baking dish generously.
   - In a saucepan, combine heavy cream, minced garlic, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Bring to a gentle simmer.
   - Layer the sliced potatoes in the buttered baking dish. Pour the cream mixture over the potatoes and top with Gruyere and Parmesan cheeses.
   - Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly.

**2. Cook the Wagyu Beef Tenderloin:**
   - Season the Wagyu steaks with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
   - In a large skillet, heat olive oil and add butter. Once the butter is melted, add garlic cloves and thyme.
   - Sear the tenderloin steaks in the skillet over medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare doneness. Remove from the heat and let rest.

**3. Sear the Foie Gras:**
   - Season foie gras slices with sea salt and pepper.
   - In a non-stick pan, sear foie gras on high heat for about 30 seconds on each side until browned. Remove and let rest briefly.

**4. Make the Perigord Truffle Jus:**
   - In a saucepan, heat olive oil and sauté shallots and garlic until translucent. Add red wine, bring to a boil, and reduce by half.
   - Add beef stock and reduce by half again. Stir in truffle oil and finish with butter for a glossy sauce.
   - Add shaved Perigord truffle and gently heat through.

#### Assembly:
   - Plate each Wagyu steak, covering with a slice of seared foie gras.
   - Serve with a generous portion of potato gratin.
   - Drizzle Perigord truffle jus over the steaks and around the plate.
   - Garnish with additional shaved truffle if desired.

**Wine Pairing:**
- Enjoy with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, particularly the robust and elegant Harlan Estate 2014. The wine's rich body complements the luxurious character of the Wagyu and foie gras, enhancing the dish's depth and complexity.
