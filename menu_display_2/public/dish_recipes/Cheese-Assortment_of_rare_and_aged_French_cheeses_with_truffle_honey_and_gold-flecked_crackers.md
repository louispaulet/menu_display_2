### Instructions:

1. **Preparation of Cheese:**
   - Remove all cheeses from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before serving to allow them to reach room temperature, which enhances their flavor and texture.

2. **Plating the Cheeses:**
   - Arrange the cheeses in a clockwise or spiral pattern on a large wooden board or marble slab, beginning with the mildest cheese (Brie de Meaux) progressing to the stronger varieties (Époisses de Bourgogne and Roquefort).

3. **Adding Accompaniments:**
   - Place the fresh figs, toasted nuts, and dried apricots in small clusters around the cheeses for color and varied texture.
   - Drizzle truffle honey over the Comté and Brie de Meaux or serve it in a small bowl for guests to help themselves.

4. **Presenting the Crackers:**
   - Arrange the gold-flecked crackers in a fan shape or linear pattern along the edge of the board or on a separate platter.

5. **Serving:**
   - Pair with a glass of **Château Mouton Rothschild Pauillac 2015** to enhance the flavors and provide a full-bodied, luxurious tasting experience.

### Tips:
- **Cheese Knife Set:** Provide a variety of cheese knives or spreaders specific for each type of cheese to ensure proper serving.
- **Butter Knife for Honey:** Consider providing a small butter knife for serving the truffle honey, preventing contamination of the honey jar with other flavors.

### Wine Pairing:
- **Château Mouton Rothschild Pauillac 2015**
  - This full-bodied Bordeaux with its robust tannins and notes of blackcurrant, cedar, and spices elegantly complements the rich and varied flavors of the cheeses, enhancing the dining experience.
