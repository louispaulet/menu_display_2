### Seared Scallops with Black Truffle and Jerusalem Artichoke Purée

#### Ingredients:

**For the Jerusalem Artichoke Purée:**
- 500g Jerusalem artichokes, peeled and cut into chunks
- 250ml heavy cream
- Salt, to taste
- White pepper, to taste
- 30g unsalted butter

**For the Seared Scallops:**
- 8 large sea scallops, cleaned and patted dry
- Sea salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

**For the Garnish:**
- Fresh black truffle, thinly shaved
- Fresh herbs (e.g., chervil or microgreens)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Jerusalem Artichoke Purée:**
   - In a medium saucepan, combine the Jerusalem artichokes and heavy cream.
   - Simmer over medium heat until the artichokes are tender, about 15 minutes.
   - Transfer the mixture to a blender and purée until smooth.
   - Season with salt and white pepper to taste.
   - Add the butter and blend until fully incorporated. Keep warm.

2. **Sear the Scallops:**
   - Season the scallops lightly with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat until shimmering.
   - Add the scallops to the pan, ensuring they are not crowded.
   - Sear for about 1-2 minutes on each side until a golden crust forms. Avoid moving them too much to achieve a solid sear.
   - In the last 30 seconds of cooking, add the butter to the pan and baste the scallops with it.
   - Remove the scallops from the pan and let them rest briefly on a warm plate.

3. **Plating:**
   - Spoon the warm Jerusalem artichoke purée onto each plate, creating a small bed.
   - Place two scallops on each bed of purée.
   - Top the scallops with a thin slice of black truffle.
   - Garnish with fresh herbs such as chervil or microgreens.

4. **Serve:**
   - Serve immediately, inviting guests to enjoy this luxurious appetizer with a chilled glass of Meursault Domaine des Comtes Lafon Les Perrières 2018, which complements the dish beautifully with its rich and complex notes.
