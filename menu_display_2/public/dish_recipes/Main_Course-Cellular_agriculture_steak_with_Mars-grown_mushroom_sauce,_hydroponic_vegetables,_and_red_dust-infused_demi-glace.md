### Red Dust-Infused Demi-Glace

## Instructions

### Preparing the Steak:
1. Remove steaks from refrigeration and bring to room temperature. Season steaks with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
2. Heat Martian olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Sear the steaks for 2-3 minutes on each side or until they reach your preferred doneness.
3. Remove steaks from the pan and allow to rest.

### Making the Mars-grown Mushroom Sauce:
1. In the same pan used for the steaks, add Martian olive oil.
2. Sauté the shallot, garlic, and thyme until softened.
3. Add the Mars-grown mushrooms and cook until they begin to caramelize.
4. Deglaze the pan with Martian red wine, scraping up any flavorful bits from the pan, and allow to reduce by half.
5. Add the vegetarian beef stock and continue reducing until the sauce has a thick consistency.
6. Stir in the Martian butter until melted and the sauce is smooth.

### Preparing the Hydroponic Vegetables:
1. Heat Martian olive oil in a separate pan over medium heat.
2. Sauté the hydroponic kale and carrots until just tender.
3. Season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice.

### Crafting the Red Dust-Infused Demi-Glace:
1. Combine the Mars base demi-glace, Martian red wine, and a pinch of dehydrated Martian red dust in a small saucepan.
2. Heat gently, stirring occasionally until the mixture is smooth and slightly thickened.

### Plating:
1. Place the steak on a warmed plate, spoon the Mars-grown mushroom sauce artfully over the steak.
2. Arrange hydroponic vegetables beside the steak.
3. Drizzle the red dust-infused demi-glace around the dish for an elegant finish.
4. Serve immediately with a glass of Deimos Heights Pinot Noir 2050.
