- 1 teaspoon capers, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice

### For the Pine Nut 'Parmesan':

## Instructions

### Preparing the Pine Nut 'Parmesan':
1. In a food processor, combine the pine nuts, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, and sea salt.
2. Pulse until the mixture reaches a fine, crumbly texture, resembling grated Parmesan cheese. Set aside.

### Preparing the Tomato Tartare:
1. Blanch the tomatoes by scoring a small "X" on the bottom of each, then submerge them in boiling water for 30 seconds, followed by an ice water bath.
2. Once cool, peel and remove the skins from the tomatoes.
3. Cut the tomatoes in half, remove the seeds, and then dice into small, uniform cubes.
4. Place the diced tomatoes in a mixing bowl. Add the minced shallots, chopped capers, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Stir gently to blend the flavors well.
5. Cover and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

### Assembly:
1. Scoop a small tablespoon of the tomato tartare into a small serving dish or spoon.
2. Top with a sprinkle of the pine nut 'Parmesan'.
3. Garnish with fresh basil microgreens for a burst of color and flavor.

### Serving:
Pair with a chilled glass of Domaine Leflaive Puligny-Montrachet 2018 to enhance the fresh flavors of the tomatoes and the richness of the pine nut ‘Parmesan’.

## Tips:
- Choose heirloom tomatoes that are firm but ripe to ensure the best texture and flavor.
- For added depth, try using a hint of aged balsamic vinegar as a finishing touch right before serving.
