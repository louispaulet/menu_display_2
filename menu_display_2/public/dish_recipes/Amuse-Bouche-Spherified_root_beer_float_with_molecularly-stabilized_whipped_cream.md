### Description
A delightful amuse-bouche that encapsulates the nostalgia of a root beer float with a modern gastronomic twist. This dish features spherified root beer served with a cloud of stabilized whipped cream.

### Ingredients

#### For the Spherified Root Beer
- 500ml high-quality root beer
- 5g sodium alginate
- 1 liter distilled water
- 5g calcium lactate

#### For the Molecularly-Stabilized Whipped Cream
- 250ml heavy cream (at least 36% fat content)
- 2 tbsp confectioners' sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1g xanthan gum

### Equipment
- Immersion blender
- Fine mesh sieve
- Spherification spoon
- Bowl
- Hand mixer or whisk

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Spherified Root Beer
1. **Alginate Solution**: In a bowl, slowly blend the sodium alginate into distilled water using the immersion blender until fully dissolved. Set aside to let air bubbles dissipate (about 15 minutes).

2. **Calcium Bath**: In another bowl, dissolve calcium lactate in fresh distilled water, stirring until fully dissolved.

3. **Root Beer Base**: Mix the root beer with a teaspoon of the prepared alginate solution. Use the immersion blender to ensure complete dissolution.

4. **Spherification**:
   - Use a syringe or pipette to gently drop the root beer alginate mixture into the calcium lactate bath.
   - Leave the spheres to form for about 2 minutes, transferring them to a bowl of clean water afterwards to rinse off excess calcium solution.

5. **Storage**: Keep the spherified root beer spheres in a submerged bowl of plain distilled water until ready to serve.

#### Prepare the Molecularly-Stabilized Whipped Cream
1. **Whip the Cream**:
   - Whisk the heavy cream with an electric hand mixer until it begins to thicken.
   - Slowly add the confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract while continuing to whisk.

2. **Add Xanthan Gum**: Sprinkle in xanthan gum gradually, continuing to whisk until the mixture reaches stiff peaks.

3. **Storage**: Place the whipped cream in a chilled piping bag with a nozzle of your choice for elegant presentation.

### Assembly
1. Carefully place 2-3 root beer spheres on a small amuse-bouche spoon or dish.
2. Pipe a dollop of the stabilized whipped cream beside the spheres.
3. Garnish with a mint leaf for freshness or a small piece of a vanilla pod.

### Pairing
Serve this with a chilled glass of Gamma-7 Sparkling Nebula Wine to accentuate the effervescent elements of the root beer float. The wineâ€™s lively bubbles and aromatic profile complement the spherified delight.

### Enjoyment
Serve immediately for the full sensory experience, encouraging guests to consume the entire spoonful to enjoy the burst of root beer flavor and creamy finish.
