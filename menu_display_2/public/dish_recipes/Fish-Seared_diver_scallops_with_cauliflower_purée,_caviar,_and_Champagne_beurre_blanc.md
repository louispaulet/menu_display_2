#### Ingredients:

**For the Scallops:**
- 12 large diver scallops, cleaned
- Salt and freshly ground white pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

**For the Cauliflower Purée:**
- 1 head cauliflower, florets only
- 2 cups whole milk
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Salt and freshly ground white pepper, to taste

**For the Champagne Beurre Blanc:**
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 1 cup Champagne
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 8 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed
- Salt and freshly ground white pepper, to taste

**Garnish:**
- 2 ounces high-quality caviar
- Finely chopped chives or microgreens (optional)

#### Instructions:

**For the Cauliflower Purée:**
1. In a medium saucepan, combine cauliflower florets and milk. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until cauliflower is very tender, about 10-12 minutes.
2. Drain the cauliflower, reserving a bit of the milk.
3. In a blender or food processor, purée the cauliflower with butter until smooth. Adjust consistency with reserved milk if needed. Season with salt and white pepper. Keep warm.

**For the Champagne Beurre Blanc:**
1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine shallot, Champagne, and white wine vinegar. Reduce until about 1/4 cup of liquid remains.
2. Strain the reduction to remove shallot.
3. Return reduction to the saucepan and add cream. Reduce slightly.
4. Over low heat, whisk in butter one cube at a time until emulsified and creamy. Do not overheat or the sauce may separate.
5. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Keep warm.

**For the Scallops:**
1. Pat scallops dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and white pepper.
2. Heat butter and olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
3. Add scallops and sear for 1.5 to 2 minutes on each side, until golden brown and just cooked through. Do not overcrowd the pan.
4. Remove scallops from pan and let rest for a minute.

#### Assembly:
1. Spoon a generous amount of cauliflower purée onto each plate.
2. Place seared scallops atop the purée.
3. Drizzle Champagne beurre blanc around the purée and scallops.
4. Top each scallop with a small amount of caviar.
5. Garnish with chives or microgreens if desired.

#### Wine Pairing:
Enjoy this dish with a glass of **Puligny-Montrachet Domaine Leflaive Les Pucelles 2016** to complement the delicate flavors and elegance of the scallops.
