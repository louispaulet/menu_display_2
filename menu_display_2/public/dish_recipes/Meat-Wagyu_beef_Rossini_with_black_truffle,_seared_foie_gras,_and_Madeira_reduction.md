## Wagyu Beef Rossini with Black Truffle, Seared Foie Gras, and Madeira Reduction

### Wine Pairing
- **Suggested Wine**: Château Pétrus Pomerol 2014

### Ingredients
- 2 portions of Wagyu beef fillet steak (approximately 180g each)
- 2 slices of fresh foie gras (approximately 50g each)
- 1 black truffle (about 30g)
- 50ml Madeira wine
- 100ml beef stock or demi-glace
- 50g unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Fresh chives, for garnish

### Instructions

#### Preparing the Madeira Reduction
1. **Reduce Madeira & Stock:**
   - In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, pour the Madeira wine and let it reduce by half.
   - Add the beef stock or demi-glace and continue to reduce until it thickens to a sauce consistency.
   - Whisk in the chilled butter cubes until the sauce is glossy. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm.

#### Cooking the Wagyu Beef
2. **Prepare the Steaks:**
   - Let the Wagyu steaks come to room temperature and season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
3. **Sear the Steaks:**
   - Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a heavy-bottom skillet over high heat. Once shimmering, add the steaks.
   - Sear each side for 3-4 minutes, depending on your preferred doneness (aim for medium-rare for optimal flavor and texture).
   - Remove the steaks from the skillet and let them rest on a warm plate, covered loosely with foil.

#### Cooking the Foie Gras
4. **Prepare the Foie Gras:**
   - Season the foie gras slices with salt and pepper.
5. **Sear the Foie Gras:**
   - In a separate non-stick pan, heat the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
   - Add the foie gras slices and sear for about 1 minute on each side until golden-brown and crisp.
   - Remove from the pan and place each slice on top of the resting Wagyu steaks.

#### Assembling the Dish
6. **Truffle Shavings:**
   - Using a truffle shaver or a very sharp knife, thinly shave the black truffle over the steaks and foie gras.
7. **Plate and Serve:**
   - Place each steak with foie gras and truffle onto heated plates.
   - Spoon the Madeira reduction around and slightly over the top.
   - Garnish with fresh chives.
8. **Wine Pairing:**
   - Serve with a glass of Château Pétrus Pomerol 2014 for a luxurious dining experience.
