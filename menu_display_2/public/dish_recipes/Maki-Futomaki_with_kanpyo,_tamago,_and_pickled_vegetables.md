## Futomaki with Kanpyo, Tamago, and Pickled Vegetables

### Ingredients:

#### Rice
- 2 cups sushi rice
- 2 1/4 cups water
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt

#### Fillings
- 1/4 cup kanpyo (dried gourd strips)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon mirin
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon sake
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon dashi stock
- 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons pickled daikon, or takuan, cut into thin strips
- 1/4 cucumber, julienned
- 1 sheet pickled ginger, thinly sliced

#### Assembly
- 3 sheets nori (dried seaweed)
- Bamboo sushi mat
- Water in a small bowl (to wet hands)

### Instructions:

#### Preparing the Sushi Rice
1. Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain thoroughly.
2. In a saucepan, combine rice and 2 1/4 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
3. Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for another 10 minutes.
4. In a small bowl, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved. Fold this mixture into the cooked rice. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature.

#### Preparing the Kanpyo
1. Rinse kanpyo and soak in water for about 20 minutes. Drain and squeeze out excess water.
2. In a saucepan, combine kanpyo with soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. Simmer until liquid is almost gone and kanpyo is tender. Set aside to cool.

#### Making the Tamago (Japanese Omelette)
1. In a small bowl, beat eggs with sake, sugar, dashi stock, soy sauce, and salt.
2. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and light coat with oil. Pour a small amount of egg mixture to cover the bottom of the pan.
3. Roll the cooked layer to one side of the pan. Pour another small amount of egg mixture to cover the pan again, lifting the cooked egg roll and letting the new layer flow underneath. Repeat rolling.
4. Continue this process until all the egg mixture is used. Allow the omelet to cool, then slice into long strips.

#### Assembling the Futomaki
1. Place a sheet of nori on the bamboo mat.
2. Wet your hands to avoid rice sticking. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top.
3. Arrange strips of kanpyo, tamago, pickled daikon, cucumber, and pickled ginger across the center of the rice.
4. Using the mat, carefully roll the nori over the filling, pressing tightly to secure the roll. Moisten the edge of the nori to seal the roll.
5. Using a sharp knife, slice the roll into 6 to 8 pieces, wiping the knife with a damp cloth between cuts.

### Serving Suggestions:
- Serve futomaki on a platter garnished with pickled ginger and wasabi.
- Pair with Dewazakura Oka Ginjo for a refreshing complement to the flavors.
