   - Gently fold the egg yolk mixture into the melted chocolate until well combined.

3. **Whip the Egg Whites:**
   - In another clean bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form.
   - Gradually add the remaining sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks form.

4. **Beat the Cream:**
   - In a separate chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream with vanilla extract until soft peaks form.

5. **Combine:**
   - Fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture gently.
   - Fold in the egg whites in thirds, being careful not to deflate the mixture.

6. **Chill:**
   - Spoon the mousse into serving glasses or bowls and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until set.

### Prepare the Holographic Fruit Garnish:
1. **Prepare the Fruit:**
   - Slice the fruits carefully into desired shapes.

2. **Coat with Honey Mixture:**
   - Mix honey and lemon juice in a small bowl.
   - Lightly glaze each fruit piece with the honey-lemon mixture using a pastry brush.

3. **Add the Shimmer:**
   - Dust each piece with edible holographic shimmer using a clean, dry brush.
   - Set aside until ready to serve.

### Serve:
