### Mushroom and Truffle Pâté with Toasted Brioche and Microgreens

#### Ingredients:

**For the pâté:**

- 300g of mixed mushrooms (shiitake, cremini, and porcini)
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil
- 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter
- 1 small shallot, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves
- 1 tablespoon of fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 50ml of dry white wine
- 100g of cream cheese
- 1 tablespoon of truffle oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

**For the toasted brioche:**

- 4 slices of brioche bread
- 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter

**Garnish:**

- A handful of microgreens (such as pea shoots or arugula microgreens)
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Drizzle of extra virgin olive oil

#### Directions:

##### Preparing the Pâté:

1. **Clean and Chop the Mushrooms**: Gently clean the mushrooms with a damp cloth to remove any dirt, then finely chop them.

2. **Sauté the Aromatics**: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the shallot and garlic, cooking until translucent and fragrant.

3. **Cook the Mushrooms**: Increase the heat to medium-high and add the mushrooms to the skillet. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the mushrooms are golden and any liquid is evaporated.

4. **Deglaze the Pan**: Stir in the white wine and allow it to evaporate, scraping up any browned bits from the skillet.

5. **Flavors and Blend**: Add the thyme, parsley, and remaining butter, allowing it to melt and coat the mushrooms. Transfer the mushroom mixture into a food processor, add cream cheese and truffle oil, then pulse until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

6. **Chill**: Transfer the pâté to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to let the flavors meld.

##### Preparing the Toasted Brioche:

1. **Toast the Brioche**: Butter both sides of the brioche slices. In a nonstick skillet over medium heat, toast each slice until golden brown, 2-3 minutes per side.

##### Plating:

1. **Assemble**: On each serving plate, place a dollop of mushroom and truffle pâté.
2. **Add the Toast**: Arrange toasted brioche slices alongside the pâté.
3. **Garnish**: Top with a small handful of microgreens, a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper, and a light drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

#### Wine Pairing:

- **Champagne** Ruinart Blanc de Blancs Brut.
