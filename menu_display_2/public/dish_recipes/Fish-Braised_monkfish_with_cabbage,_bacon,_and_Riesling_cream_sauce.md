## Braised Monkfish with Cabbage, Bacon, and Riesling Cream Sauce

### Ingredients:

#### Monkfish:
- 2 monkfish tails, skin and membrane removed (approx. 1.5 lbs total)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

#### Cabbage and Bacon:
- 4 strips thick-cut bacon, diced
- 1 small head of green cabbage, cored and thinly sliced
- 1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

#### Riesling Cream Sauce:
- 1 cup dry Riesling wine
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, for garnish

### Instructions:

#### Prepare the Monkfish:
1. Season the monkfish tails with salt and pepper on both sides.
2. Heat olive oil in a large, ovenproof pan over medium-high heat.
3. Add the monkfish and sear until golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side.
4. Remove from the pan and set aside.

#### Prepare the Cabbage and Bacon:
5. In the same pan, add the bacon and cook over medium heat until crispy.
6. Use a slotted spoon to remove the bacon, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.
7. Add the onion to the pan and sauté until translucent, about 3 minutes.
8. Stir in the garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute.
9. Add the cabbage to the pan, season with salt and pepper, and sauté until wilted, about 5-7 minutes.
10. Return the bacon to the pan and stir to combine.

#### Make the Riesling Cream Sauce:
11. Pour the Riesling wine into the pan, stirring to deglaze and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom.
12. Allow the wine to reduce by half, about 5 minutes.
13. Reduce the heat to low, stir in the heavy cream, butter, and Dijon mustard.
14. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and simmer gently for another 5 minutes until slightly thickened.

#### Assemble and Finish the Dish:
15. Return the monkfish to the pan, nestling it into the cabbage and sauce or pouring over the sauce generously.
16. Cover the pan and place it into the preheated oven at 375°F (190°C).
17. Braise the monkfish for 15-20 minutes, until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
18. Remove the pan from the oven and garnish with fresh chives.

19. Carefully plate the monkfish over a bed of the cabbage and bacon, generously drizzling the Riesling cream sauce over the top.
