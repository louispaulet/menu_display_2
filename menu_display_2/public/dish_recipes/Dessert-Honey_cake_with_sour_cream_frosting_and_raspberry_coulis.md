## Instructions

### For the Honey Cake:
1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line two 8-inch round cake pans with parchment paper.
2. **Mix Wet Ingredients:** In a large bowl, beat the honey, sugar, and butter together until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
3. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon.
4. **Combine and Mix:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with milk. Stir in the lemon zest and vanilla extract.
5. **Bake:** Divide the batter equally between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
6. **Cool:** Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

### For the Sour Cream Frosting:
1. **Mix Ingredients:** In a bowl, whip the sour cream, mascarpone cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy.
2. **Chill:** Refrigerate frosting until ready to use.

### For the Raspberry Coulis:
1. **Cook Raspberries:** In a saucepan, combine raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat until the raspberries break down and the mixture begins to thicken, about 10 minutes.
2. **Strain:** Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve to remove seeds. Allow to cool completely.

### To Assemble:
1. **Layer Cake:** Place one layer of the cake on a serving platter. Spread a generous amount of sour cream frosting over the top.
2. **Add Second Layer:** Place the second cake layer on top and coat the entire cake with the remaining frosting.
3. **Decorate:** Drizzle raspberry coulis over the top and allow some to drip down the sides.
4. **Garnish:** Garnish with fresh raspberries and mint leaves if desired.
