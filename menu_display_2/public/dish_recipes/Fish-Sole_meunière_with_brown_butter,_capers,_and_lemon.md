## Sole Meuni√®re with Brown Butter, Capers, and Lemon

### Ingredients
- 4 sole fillets, skinless
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, for dredging
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons)
- 1/4 cup capers, drained
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- Lemon wedges, for serving

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Fillets:**
   - Pat the sole fillets dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
   - Spread the all-purpose flour on a plate or shallow dish. Dredge each fillet in the flour, shaking off the excess.

2. **Cook the Sole:**
   - Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter begins to foam, add the fillets, working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pan.
   - Cook the fillets for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and just cooked through. Transfer the cooked fillets to a warm plate.

3. **Make the Brown Butter Sauce:**
   - Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the same skillet. Cook, stirring often, until the butter turns a light brown color and develops a nutty aroma, about 2 minutes.
   - Stir in the fresh lemon juice and capers, carefully scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
   
4. **Serve:**
   - Pour the brown butter sauce over the cooked sole fillets.
   - Sprinkle with the chopped parsley.
   - Serve immediately with lemon wedges on the side.

### Wine Pairing
- Serve with a glass of Louis Roederer Cristal Brut 2012 to complement the richness of the sole and the citrus notes of the dish.
