## Ingredients

### For the Mandu:
- 300g ground Icelandic lamb
- 1/2 cup finely chopped onion
- 1/2 cup chopped fermented cabbage
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 30 mandu or dumpling wrappers

### For the Doenjang Dipping Sauce:
- 2 tablespoons doenjang (Korean fermented soybean paste)
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon honey
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped green onions
- 1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds

## Instructions

### Preparing the Mandu Filling:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground lamb, chopped onion, fermented cabbage, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, black pepper, and salt.
2. Mix all the ingredients thoroughly until well integrated.
3. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

### Assembling the Mandu:
4. Remove the lamb mixture from the refrigerator.
5. Place a dumpling wrapper on a clean work surface.
6. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of lamb mixture into the center of the wrapper.
7. Wet the edges of the wrapper with a little water, fold over to create a half-moon shape, and press the edges firmly to seal.
8. Continue with the remaining wrappers and filling.

### Cooking the Mandu:
9. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat and add a small amount of oil.
10. When the oil is hot, place the dumplings in the pan, ensuring they are not touching.
11. Cook for about 2 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown.
12. Carefully add about 1/4 cup of water to the pan, then cover and steam for 5-6 minutes until the dumplings are cooked through.
13. Remove the lid and cook for a further 1-2 minutes to crisp the bottoms again.

### Making the Doenjang Dipping Sauce:
14. In a small bowl, whisk together the doenjang, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, and green onions.
15. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds before serving.
