## Crème Brûlée with Vanilla and Raspberry, Gold Leaf Garnish

### Description
A rich and creamy vanilla-flavored dessert topped with a layer of caramelized sugar, complemented by fresh raspberries and a luxurious gold leaf garnish.

### Ingredients

- **For the Crème Brûlée:**
  - 4 cups heavy cream
  - 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped (or 1 tablespoon vanilla extract)
  - 8 large egg yolks
  - 3/4 cup granulated sugar, plus more for caramelizing
  - Pinch of salt

- **For the Topping:**
  - Fresh raspberries
  - Edible gold leaf (optional)

### Equipment

- Ramekins
- Baking dish
- Kitchen torch (or broiler)

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Vanilla Cream:**
   - Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). 
   - In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the heavy cream and vanilla bean (or vanilla extract). Heat until just simmering, then remove from heat and let it steep for about 10 minutes. If using a vanilla bean, remove it after steeping.

2. **Combine Yolks and Sugar:**
   - In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 3/4 cup sugar, and a pinch of salt until well combined and the mixture lightens in color.

3. **Mix the Custard Base:**
   - Gradually add the warm cream to the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.

4. **Prepare for Baking:**
   - Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl to remove any cooked egg bits.
   - Divide the custard base evenly among the ramekins. 
   - Place the ramekins in a baking dish and add hot water halfway up the sides of the ramekins (bain-marie technique).

5. **Bake the Custard:**
   - Carefully transfer the baking dish to the preheated oven. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the custards are set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center.
   - Remove the ramekins from the baking dish and cool to room temperature. Then refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until thoroughly chilled.

6. **Caramelize the Sugar:**
   - Just before serving, sprinkle a thin layer of granulated sugar evenly over the top of each custard.
   - Using a kitchen torch, melt the sugar until it forms a crispy, golden layer. (Alternatively, broil under intense heat for a similar effect.)

7. **Garnish and Serve:**
   - Top each crème brûlée with fresh raspberries.
   - Carefully apply small pieces of edible gold leaf atop each custard as a luxurious finish.
