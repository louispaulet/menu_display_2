## Roasted Duck with Orange and Kumquat, Foie Gras, and Black Currant Sauce

### Ingredients

#### For the Roasted Duck:
- 1 whole duck (about 4-5 lbs)
- 1 tablespoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 orange, quartered
- 100g kumquats, halved
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme

#### For the Foie Gras:
- 200g foie gras
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

#### For the Black Currant Sauce:
- 200ml black currant juice
- 50ml red wine
- 30ml balsamic vinegar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

### Instructions

#### Preparing the Duck:
1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 190°C (375°F).
   
2. **Prepare the Duck:** Pat the duck dry with paper towels. Season the cavity and skin with salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity with orange quarters and kumquat halves.
   
3. **Roast the Duck:** Place the duck on a roasting rack inside a roasting pan, brush with olive oil, and add thyme sprigs.
   
4. **Cooking Time:** Roast the duck in the oven for about 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°F). Allow the duck to rest for 15 minutes before carving.

#### Preparing the Foie Gras:
5. **Slicing:** While the duck is roasting, slice the foie gras into 1cm thick pieces. Season each side with salt and pepper.
   
6. **Searing Foie Gras:** In a hot skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Sear the foie gras for about 1-2 minutes on each side until golden brown. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess fat.

#### Preparing the Black Currant Sauce:
7. **Reducing the Sauce:** Combine black currant juice, red wine, balsamic vinegar, and honey in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer until the sauce has reduced by half.
   
8. **Finish:** Remove from heat and whisk in butter until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

### Plating the Dish:
9. **Presenting:** Carve the duck and plate with seared foie gras. Drizzle with black currant sauce.
   
10. **Garnishment:** Optionally garnish with thin slices of fresh kumquat and thyme sprigs.

### Wine Pairing:
- Enjoy with a glass of **Château Mouton Rothschild 2009** to complement the rich flavors of the duck and foie gras.
