## Microgravity-grown Salad with Asteroidal Vinaigrette and Solar-dried Tomatoes

### Ingredients

#### Salad
- 4 cups microgravity-grown baby greens (such as arugula, spinach, and mizuna)
- 1/2 cup solar-dried cherry tomatoes
- 1/4 cup roasted meteoritic pumpkin seeds
- 1 small asteroid cucumber, thinly sliced 
- 1/4 cup space-harvested feta cheese, crumbled
- Edible stardust (optional, for garnish)

#### Asteroidal Vinaigrette
- 1/4 cup Proxima B olive oil
- 2 tablespoons interstellar vinegar (a white wine vinegar alternative)
- 1 tablespoon meteor honey
- 1 teaspoon comet mustard (Dijon-style)
- Salt from the Rings of Saturn, to taste
- Freshly ground black void pepper, to taste

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Salad**
   - In a large space-proof salad bowl, combine the microgravity-grown baby greens, solar-dried cherry tomatoes, roasted meteoritic pumpkin seeds, asteroid cucumber slices, and crumbled space-harvested feta cheese.
   - Toss gently with clean meteoric tongs to ensure all ingredients are evenly distributed.

2. **Make the Asteroidal Vinaigrette**
   - In a small cosmic mixing bowl, whisk together the Proxima B olive oil, interstellar vinegar, meteor honey, and comet mustard until emulsified.
   - Season with salt from the Rings of Saturn and freshly ground black void pepper to taste.

3. **Dress the Salad**
   - Pour the asteroidal vinaigrette over the salad ingredients in the bowl.
   - Toss the salad lightly to ensure an even coating of the dressing over the greens and toppings.

4. **Garnish and Serve**
   - If desired, sprinkle a pinch of edible stardust over the salad for a celestial touch.
   - Transfer the salad to serving plates.

5. **Pair with Wine**
   - Serve the salad with a chilled glass of Proxima Centauri Chardonnay 2998 to enhance the flavors of the dish.

### Notes
- Solar-dried tomatoes can be prepared by sun-drying cherry tomatoes on a sunny asteroidal surface for a few weeks to intensify their sweetness.
- If microgravity-grown greens are unavailable, organic Earth-grown greens may be substituted.
- The asteroidal vinaigrette can be adjusted to taste by adding more honey for sweetness or additional vinegar for tartness.
