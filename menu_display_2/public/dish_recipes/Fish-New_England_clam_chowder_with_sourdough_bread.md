# New England Clam Chowder with Sourdough Bread

## Ingredients

### For the Chowder:
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 stalks celery, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 4 cups clam juice or seafood stock
- 2 large russet potatoes, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch cubes
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 2 pounds fresh clams, cleaned and scrubbed
- 1 cup cooked bacon pieces (optional)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

### For the Sourdough Bread:
- 1 sourdough loaf
- Extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling
- 1 garlic clove, halved

## Instructions

### Clam Chowder:
1. **Prepare the Clams:**
   - Rinse the clams under cool running water and keep them in a bowl of salted ice water to help release any sand. Allow them to sit while preparing other ingredients.

2. **Sauté Aromatics:**
   - In a large pot over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onion, celery, and garlic. Cook until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.

3. **Create the Base:**
   - Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir well to coat, cooking for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.
   - Gradually whisk in the clam juice or seafood stock, ensuring there are no lumps. Add the potatoes, bay leaves, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper.

4. **Simmer the Soup Base:**
   - Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.

5. **Cook the Clams:**
   - Add the clams to the pot and cover. Cook until the clams open, about 6-8 minutes, discarding any that do not open.

6. **Finish the Chowder:**
   - Remove the pot from heat and stir in the heavy cream. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
   - Optionally, stir in the cooked bacon pieces.
   - Garnish with chopped parsley before serving.

### Sourdough Bread:
1. **Prepare the Loaf:**
   - Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
   - Slice the sourdough loaf thickly. Arrange slices on a baking sheet.

2. **Toast the Bread:**
   - Drizzle slices with olive oil and rub with the garlic halves.
   - Place the baking sheet in the oven and toast for about 10 minutes or until golden brown.

## Serving Suggestion:
- Ladle hot clam chowder into bowls.
- Serve accompanied by the warm sourdough bread.
- Enjoy with a glass of **Pinot Gris Willamette Valley Vineyards 2020** for a perfect pairing.
