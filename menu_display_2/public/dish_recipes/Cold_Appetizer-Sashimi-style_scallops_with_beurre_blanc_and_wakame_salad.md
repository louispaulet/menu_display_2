**Course:** Cold Appetizer  
**Wine Pairing:** Sauvignon Blanc Pascal Jolivet Sancerre 2020

## Ingredients:

### Scallops
- 8 fresh sea scallops
- Flaky sea salt
- Fresh ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- Zest of 1 lemon

### Beurre Blanc
- 1 cup white wine (preferably Sauvignon Blanc)
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- 1 small shallot, finely chopped
- 3/4 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed
- Salt and white pepper, to taste
- Fresh chives, finely chopped for garnish

### Wakame Salad
- 1/2 cup dried wakame seaweed
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
- 1 teaspoon finely grated ginger
- 1 small cucumber, julienned

## Instructions:

### Prep the Scallops
1. Pat the scallops dry with paper towels. Slice each scallop horizontally into thin sashimi-style pieces. Arrange them in a single layer on a chilled platter.
2. Season lightly with flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with lemon zest.

### Make the Beurre Blanc
1. In a small saucepan, combine white wine, white wine vinegar, and shallots. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and reduce the liquid to about a scant 1/4 cup.
2. Lower the heat to very low and gradually whisk in the cold butter cubes, one piece at a time, until the sauce is smooth and creamy.
3. Season the sauce with salt and white pepper to taste. Keep warm on the lowest heat setting, stirring occasionally.

### Prepare the Wakame Salad
1. Rehydrate the dried wakame in a bowl of warm water for about 5 minutes. Drain and squeeze out excess water.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine rehydrated wakame, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, grated ginger, and julienned cucumber.
3. Toss gently to mix all ingredients thoroughly.

### Assemble the Dish
1. Spoon a delicate circle of beurre blanc on serving plates.
2. Arrange scallop slices over the beurre blanc.
3. Mound a small portion of wakame salad in the center.
4. Garnish with chopped chives and serve immediately.

## Tips:
- Ensure the scallops are as fresh as possible, opting for those labeled "dry" if available.
- Beurre blanc should not be allowed to boil; otherwise, the sauce will split. Always keep over low heat.
- When preparing the wakame salad, adjust the seasonings to your taste, adding more soy or ginger if desired.
