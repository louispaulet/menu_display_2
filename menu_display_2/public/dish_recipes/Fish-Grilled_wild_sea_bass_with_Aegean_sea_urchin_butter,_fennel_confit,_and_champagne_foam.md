## Grilled Wild Sea Bass with Aegean Sea Urchin Butter, Fennel Confit, and Champagne Foam

### Ingredients

#### Sea Bass
- 4 wild sea bass fillets, skin on
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

#### Aegean Sea Urchin Butter
- 100g fresh sea urchin roe
- 200g unsalted butter, softened
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- Zest of 1 lemon
- Salt to taste

#### Fennel Confit
- 2 medium fennel bulbs, cleaned and thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 cup chicken stock

#### Champagne Foam
- 150ml champagne
- 100ml heavy cream
- 1 egg white
- Pinch of salt

### Preparation

#### Step 1: Aegean Sea Urchin Butter
1. Place the sea urchin roe in a small bowl and mash with a fork until smooth.
2. Combine the mashed roe with softened butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a food processor. Blend until well mixed.
3. Season with salt to taste and refrigerate until needed.

#### Step 2: Fennel Confit
1. Heat olive oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the fennel slices and sprinkle with sugar, salt, and pepper.
2. Cook gently, stirring frequently, until the fennel begins to soften and caramelize.
3. Add chicken stock and continue to cook on low heat until the fennel is fully tender and the stock has reduced. Keep warm.

#### Step 3: Grilled Sea Bass
1. Preheat a grill or grill pan over high heat.
2. Season the sea bass fillets with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil.
3. Grill the sea bass, skin-side down, until the skin is crispy—about 3-4 minutes. Flip and finish cooking for another 1-2 minutes.

#### Step 4: Champagne Foam
1. In a saucepan, gently heat the champagne and cream just until warm. Do not boil.
2. Pour the mixture into a blender. Add the egg white and salt, and blend to create foam.
3. Strain the foam through a fine sieve into a siphon gun and charge with one gas cartridge. Keep warm in a hot water bath if necessary.

### Assembly
1. Place a mound of fennel confit on each plate.
2. Lay a grilled sea bass fillet atop the fennel.
3. Add a spoonful of sea urchin butter onto each fillet, allowing it to melt slightly.
4. Dispense a cloud of champagne foam alongside or around the fish.
5. Optional: Garnish with fresh herbs like dill or fennel fronds.

### Wine Pairing
Serve this dish with Domaine Gerovassiliou Viognier Epanomi 2019, which complements the richness of the sea urchin butter and the brightness of the fennel confit.
