## Instructions

### Preparing the Lobster Tail:
1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. **Prepare the Lobster**: Carefully cut through the top shell of each lobster tail with kitchen shears. Gently pull back the shells to expose the meat without removing it.
3. **Season and Cook**: Season with salt and pepper, place a tablespoon of butter on each lobster, and roast in the oven for 10-12 minutes until just cooked through.
4. **Finishing the Lobster**: Remove from oven and allow to rest for 2 minutes before serving.

### Coconut Milk Foam:
1. **Heat the Coconut Milk**: In a small saucepan, gently heat the coconut milk without boiling.
2. **Add Soy Lecithin**: Whisk in soy lecithin until fully dissolved.
3. **Create Foam**: Use an immersion blender to aerate the mixture until a stable foam forms. Set aside.

### Hearts of Palm:
1. **Toss and Season**: Place sliced hearts of palm in a bowl with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Toss to combine and set aside.

### Lilikoi Vinaigrette:
1. **Mix Ingredients**: In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the lilikoi pulp, olive oil, vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper until well combined.

## Assembly
1. **Plating**: On a serving plate, arrange the roasted lobster tail elegantly in the center.
2. **Add Hearts of Palm**: Neatly place hearts of palm slices around the lobster tail.
3. **Foam and Drizzle**: Spoon the coconut milk foam over and around the lobster and hearts of palm, then drizzle the lilikoi vinaigrette artfully around the plate.

## Wine Pairing
For an elevated dining experience, pair this dish with a glass of Sancerre Domaine Vacheron Belle Dame 2019. Its crisp acidity and subtle fruit notes complement the sweetness of the lobster and the tropical flavors of the vinaigrette.
