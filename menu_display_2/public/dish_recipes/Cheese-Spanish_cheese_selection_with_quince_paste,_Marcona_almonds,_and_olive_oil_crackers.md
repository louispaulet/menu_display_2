1. **Prepare the Cheeses:**
   - **Manchego Cheese:*** Slice the Manchego cheese into thin wedges.
   - **Mahón Cheese:*** Cut the Mahón cheese into small squares or cubes.
   - **Cabrales Cheese:*** Allow Cabrales cheese to come to room temperature before serving, as it softens slightly and the flavors become more pronounced.

   - Slice the quince paste into thin strips. Place them on the platter around the cheeses.
   - Add a generous handful of toasted Marcona almonds to the platter for texture and nutty flavors.
   - Place olive oil crackers either around the platter or in a separate dish for easy access.

4. **Optional Garnishes:**
   - If desired, add halved fresh figs to the platter for sweet, juicy contrast.
   - Add sprigs of fresh herbs like rosemary or thyme for aroma and visual appeal.

5. **Serving:**
   - Present the platter with the bottle of Priorat Clos Mogador 2017.
   - Encourage guests to mix and match the cheeses with quince paste, almonds, and crackers, creating their own flavor combinations.
