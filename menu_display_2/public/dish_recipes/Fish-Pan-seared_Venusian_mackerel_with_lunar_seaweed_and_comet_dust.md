## Pan-seared Venusian Mackerel with Lunar Seaweed and Comet Dust

This exquisite dish features the unique flavor of Venusian mackerel, complemented by the subtle earthiness of lunar seaweed and finished with a sprinkle of comet dust for a celestial twist. Best enjoyed with a Betelgeuse Supernova Riesling 2997.

### Ingredients

- **2 fresh Venusian mackerel fillets** (ensure freshness by seeking suppliers with interplanetary logistics)
- **1 tablespoon lunar seaweed**, finely chopped (source from lunar import)
- **1 teaspoon comet dust** (available from certified galactic condiment stores)
- **Salt** 
- **Freshly ground black pepper**
- **2 tablespoons olive oil**
- **1 teaspoon lemon juice**
- **1 tablespoon unsalted butter**

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Mackerel:**
   - Pat the Venusian mackerel fillets dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper generously.

2. **Sear the Fish:**
   - Heat the olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.
   - Place the mackerel fillets skin-side down in the pan. Press down gently with a spatula to ensure an even sear.
   - Cook for approximately 3 minutes or until the skin is crispy and golden-brown.
   - Flip the mackerel carefully and add the butter into the pan.
   - Continue cooking for an additional 2-3 minutes, basting with the melted butter until the fillets are opaque and cooked through.

3. **Season with Lemon:**
   - Just before the fish finishes cooking, drizzle with lemon juice for a hint of acidity.

4. **Prepare Lunar Seaweed:**
   - While the fish is cooking, quickly sauté the lunar seaweed in a separate small pan with a touch of olive oil for about 1 minute to bring out its flavors. Set aside.

5. **Plate and Serve:**
   - Place a generous spoonful of the sautéed lunar seaweed on each plate.
   - Top with the pan-seared Venusian mackerel.
   - Lightly dust the plated dish with comet dust for a cosmic hint of flavor.
   - Serve immediately, preferably with a chilled glass of Betelgeuse Supernova Riesling 2997.

### Notes
- **Venusian Mackerel**: If unavailable, substitute with the freshest local mackerel, but note the flavor difference.
- **Comet Dust**: Handle carefully as it can be a potent seasoning.
- Pair with earthy ingredients to balance the dish's celestial character.
