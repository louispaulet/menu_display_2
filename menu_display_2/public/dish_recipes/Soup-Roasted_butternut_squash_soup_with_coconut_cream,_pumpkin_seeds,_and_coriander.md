# Roasted Butternut Squash Soup with Coconut Cream, Pumpkin Seeds, and Coriander

## Ingredients:

- 1 large butternut squash, peeled and cubed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 can (400 ml) coconut milk, divided
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds, toasted
- Fresh coriander leaves, for garnish

## Instructions:

### Step 1: Roast the Butternut Squash
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. In a large bowl, toss the butternut squash cubes with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt, and pepper.
3. Spread the cubes evenly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
4. Roast in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the squash is tender and lightly caramelized.

### Step 2: Sauté Aromatics
5. In a large pot, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat.
6. Add the diced onion and sauté for about 5 minutes, or until it is soft and translucent.
7. Stir in the garlic, cumin, ground coriander, cinnamon, and smoked paprika, cooking for an additional 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.

### Step 3: Simmer and Blend
8. Add the roasted butternut squash to the pot along with the vegetable broth.
9. Bring to a simmer and let cook for about 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
10. Remove from heat and use an immersion blender to blend until smooth. Alternatively, carefully transfer the soup in batches to a blender and purée until smooth. 

### Step 4: Finish with Coconut Milk
11. Stir in about three-quarters of the coconut milk, saving the rest for drizzling.
12. Add lime juice and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.

### Step 5: Serve
13. Ladle the soup into bowls.
14. Drizzle with the remaining coconut milk.
15. Sprinkle with toasted pumpkin seeds and fresh coriander leaves.

### Wine Pairing
Pair this soup with a glass of Warwick The First Lady Unoaked Chardonnay 2020 for an exquisite culinary experience. The wine's crisp and vibrant notes complement the soup's rich and creamy textures beautifully.
