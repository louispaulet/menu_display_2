### Instructions

#### Coconut Rice:
1. **Rinse the Rice:** Rinse the jasmine rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.
2. **Cook the Rice:** In a medium saucepan, combine coconut milk, water, coconut oil, and a pinch of salt. Stir in rice and bring to a boil over medium heat.
3. **Simmer:** Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-18 minutes until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed.
4. **Fluff and Keep Warm:** Fluff the rice with a fork and keep warm.

#### Jackfruit and Black Bean Stew:
1. **Prepare the Ingredients:** Drain and shred the jackfruit using forks to create a pulled texture.
2. **Sauté Aromatics:** In a large skillet, heat coconut oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until translucent.
3. **Add Garlic and Peppers:** Stir in garlic and red bell pepper; cook for about 2 minutes.
4. **Add Spices:** Sprinkle in cumin, smoked paprika, coriander, and chili powder. Stir continuously to toast the spices for about 1 minute.
5. **Simmer the Stew:** Add the shredded jackfruit, black beans, vegetable broth, and diced tomatoes. Stir to combine.
6. **Cook:** Bring to a simmer, lower the heat, and let it cook gently for 20 minutes until flavors meld together.
7. **Season:** Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to your taste.
8. **Finish with Cilantro:** Stir in fresh cilantro before serving.

#### Plantain Chips:
1. **Prepare Oil:** Pour vegetable oil into a heavy-bottomed pot or deep-fryer and heat to 350°F (175°C).
2. **Fry the Plantains:** Carefully add sliced plantains in small batches, frying each side until golden brown and crispy.
3. **Drain and Salt:** Remove chips with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt immediately.

### Assembly and Serving:
- **Plate Rice:** Serve a generous spoonful of coconut rice on the plate.
