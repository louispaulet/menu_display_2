### Mini Blue Corn Sope with Shredded Beef and Avocado Cream

#### Ingredients:

**For the Sopes:**
- 1 cup blue corn masa harina
- 3/4 cup water (adjust as needed)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Oil for frying (vegetable or canola)

**For the Shredded Beef:**
- 1 pound beef chuck roast
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup beef broth
- 1 canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, chopped

**For the Avocado Cream:**
- 1 ripe avocado
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- Salt to taste

**Garnish:**
- Crumbled queso fresco
- Fresh cilantro, chopped

#### Instructions:

**1. Prepare the Sopes:**
   - In a mixing bowl, combine blue corn masa harina, water, and salt. Mix thoroughly until the dough is smooth. Adjust water as necessary, aiming for a cohesive but not sticky dough.
   - Divide the dough into 1-inch balls, flattening each ball to form small discs about 2 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick.
   - Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Fry each sope until golden and slightly crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and allow to cool.

**2. Cook the Shredded Beef:**
   - Season beef chuck roast with salt and pepper. In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat, then sear the beef on all sides until browned.
   - Add onion and garlic, cooking until fragrant. Stir in ground cumin and chili powder.
   - Pour in beef broth and add the chopped chipotle pepper. Cover and simmer on low heat for 2-3 hours until the beef is tender and easily shredded with a fork.
   - Shred the beef in the pot and keep warm.

**3. Make the Avocado Cream:**
   - In a small bowl, mash the avocado with a fork. Stir in sour cream, lime juice, and a pinch of salt until smooth. Adjust seasoning as needed.

**4. Assemble the Sopes:**
   - Spoon a generous amount of shredded beef onto each sope.
   - Top with a dollop of avocado cream.
   - Garnish with crumbled queso fresco and fresh cilantro.

#### Wine Pairing:
Serve each mini sope as an amuse-bouche, accompanied by a glass of Cava Codorn√≠u Gran Plus Ultra Brut Reserva, which balances the richness of the beef and the creaminess of the avocado with its crisp and refreshing character.
