# Cream of Martian Potato Soup with Cultured Sour Cream and Bio-Printed Chives

### Ingredients:
- **2 lbs Martian potatoes** (locally cultivated, ensure high iron content)
- **4 cups water** (filtered, ensure pH balance consistent with Earth standards)
- **1 cup cultured sour cream** (Martian dairy culture, aerated for 6 hours)
- **1 medium Martian onion** (grown in LED-spectrum soil)
- **2 cloves garlic** (Earth-imported for pungency)
- **1/2 teaspoon Martian salt** (mined locally, finely ground)
- **1/4 teaspoon meteoric pepper** (ground from cosmically gathered meteoric spices)
- **2 tablespoons hydroxylated olive oil** (sourced from Earth for silky texture)
- **1/2 cup bio-printed chives** (custom 3D-printed for garnish precision)
- **1/2 cup Martian butter** (unsalted, locally churned with atmospheric consistency adjustments)
  
### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Martian Potatoes:**
   - Wash and peel the Martian potatoes, removing any russet film. Dice into 1-inch cubes for uniform cooking.

2. **Sauté Aromatics:**
   - In a Martian-compatible pressure cooking device, heat hydroxylated olive oil over medium setting until shimmering.
   - Add the diced Martian onion and minced garlic. Sauté until the onion is translucent and the garlic is aromatic, approximately 5 minutes.

3. **Cook the Potatoes:**
   - Add the diced Martian potatoes to the pot. Pour in the filtered water and sprinkle in the Martian salt and meteoric pepper. Stir to combine.
   - Seal the pressure lid, adjusting to ambient Mars pressure standards, and cook for 15 Earth minutes or until potatoes are tender.

4. **Blend the Soup:**
   - Carefully release pressure and open the lid. Use an immersion blender to purée the contents until the soup achieves a velvety texture.

5. **Incorporate Cultured Ingredients:**
   - Stir in Martian butter until fully melted and integrated. Gradually whisk in the cultured sour cream.

6. **Adjust Seasoning:**
   - Taste and adjust seasoning with more Martian salt or meteoric pepper as per preference.

7. **Serve and Garnish:**
   - Divide the soup into individual serving bowls. Top each portion with a generous sprinkle of bio-printed chives for a visually striking garnish.
   - Serve with a side of Phobos Estate Mars-grown Riesling 2047 for a complementary pairing.

### Notes:
- **Serve warm** to balance the coolness of the sour cream.
- **Wine pairing** enhances the sophisticated earthy tones of Martian potatoes.
- Experiment with various bio-printed herbs for alternative garnishing options. 

Enjoy your interplanetary culinary creation!
