## Instructions

### Step 1: Make the Choux Pastry
1. Preheat oven to 220°C (428°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a saucepan, combine milk, water, butter, salt, and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat ensuring the butter is melted.
3. Remove from heat, add flour all at once, and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan.
4. Return the paste to the heat for 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously until a thin film forms at the base of the pan.
5. Transfer to a bowl and let cool slightly. Incorporate eggs one at a time, mixing well between each addition until smooth.
6. Transfer dough to a piping bag fitted with a large plain tip. Pipe around 12cm/4-inch long lines onto the sheet.
7. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 180°C (356°F) and bake for another 15-20 minutes until golden brown.
8. Remove from oven, pierce each éclair to release steam, and let cool on a wire rack.

### Step 2: Prepare the Lemon Curd
1. In a heatproof bowl over simmering water, whisk together eggs, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest.
2. Once the sugar is dissolved, stir constantly until the mixture thickens, roughly 10-15 minutes, until it coats the back of a spoon.
3. Remove from heat, whisk in butter pieces until smooth.
4. Strain the mixture into another bowl and cool to room temperature before refrigerating (at least 2 hours).

### Step 3: Make the Meringue
1. Whip egg whites with cream of tartar until frothy.
2. Gradually add sugar, beating until stiff peaks form.

### Step 4: Assemble the Éclairs
1. Use a small round tip and the piping bag to fill each éclair with lemon curd through the holes made earlier.
2. Top each éclair with meringue by spreading or piping on top.
3. Use a kitchen torch to lightly brown the meringue.

## Wine Pairing
- Serve with a chilled glass of **Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise Domaine de Durban 2018** to complement the tangy and sweet flavors of the éclair.
