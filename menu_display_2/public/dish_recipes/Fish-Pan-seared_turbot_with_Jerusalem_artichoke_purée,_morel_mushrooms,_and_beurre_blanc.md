### Morel Mushrooms
- 100g morel mushrooms, cleaned and halved
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, finely chopped

### Beurre Blanc Sauce
- 1 small shallot, finely chopped
- 100ml white wine (a good quality, such as the Meursault)
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 100g cold unsalted butter, cubed
- Salt, to taste
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

## Instructions

### Prepare the Jerusalem Artichoke Purée
1. Boil the peeled and sliced Jerusalem artichokes in salted water until tender, about 20 minutes.
2. Drain and place them in a blender with the butter and cream. Blend until smooth.
3. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and keep warm until serving.

### Cook the Morel Mushrooms
1. In a skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
2. Add morel mushrooms and cook until tender, about 5-7 minutes.
3. Season with salt, pepper, and stir in the chopped parsley. Set aside and keep warm.

### Make the Beurre Blanc Sauce
1. Place the shallot, white wine, and vinegar in a saucepan over medium heat.
2. Reduce to about 1 tablespoon of liquid.
3. Turn heat to low, and whisk in the butter cubes a few at a time to create a creamy sauce.
4. Season with salt and add lemon juice. Strain if desired, and keep warm.

### Cook the Turbot
1. Pat the turbot fillets dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper.
2. Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place the fillets skin-side down in the pan.
3. Cook for about 3 minutes, then flip and add the butter. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, basting with the melted butter, until just cooked through.

### Assembly
1. Place a dollop of the Jerusalem artichoke purée slightly off-center on each plate.
2. Nestle the pan-seared turbot fillet on top.
3. Scatter morel mushrooms around the plate.
4. Drizzle with the beurre blanc sauce and serve immediately.

## Suggested Wine Pairing
- **Meursault Les Narvaux Domaine Michelot 2018:** A well-structured Chardonnay with notes of citrus, brioche, and vanilla. Its richness complements the creamy elements of the dish and highlights the delicate flavors of the turbot and morels.
