### Instructions

#### Chocolate Lava Cake
1. **Preheat the oven** to 200°C (390°F). Grease four ramekins with butter and dust with flour. Tap out excess flour.
2. **Melt chocolate and butter**: Over a double boiler or in a microwave, melt the dark chocolate and butter together until smooth. Allow it to cool slightly.
3. **Whisk eggs and sugar**: In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, and egg yolks until fluffy and pale.
4. **Combine mixtures**: Gently fold the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture until combined. Sift and fold in the flour and salt until just mixed.
5. **Fill ramekins**: Divide the batter equally into the prepared ramekins.
6. **Bake** for 10-12 minutes until the edges are firm but the center is soft.
7. **Cool slightly**: Allow cakes to cool in ramekins for 2 minutes before inverting onto plates.

#### Passion Fruit Coulis
1. **Prepare fruits**: Halve passion fruits and scoop out the seeds and pulp into a blender.
2. **Blend**: Add sugar, water, and lime juice in the blender and process until smooth.
3. **Strain**: Pass the mixture through a fine sieve into a saucepan to remove the seeds.
4. **Simmer**: Heat the mixture over low heat for 5 minutes until slightly thickened.
5. **Cool**: Remove from heat and allow to cool before serving.

#### Macadamia Nut Ice Cream
1. **Infuse milk**: In a saucepan, combine milk, cream, half of the sugar, and vanilla seeds and pod. Heat over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Remove from heat and allow to steep.
2. **Whisk yolks and sugar**: In a bowl, whisk together egg yolks and remaining sugar until pale.
3. **Temper eggs**: Gradually pour warm milk mixture into egg yolks, whisking constantly to avoid curdling.
4. **Thicken**: Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon.
5. **Ice bath**: Transfer to a bowl set over an ice bath to cool quickly.
6. **Churn**: When cooled, churn in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions, adding macadamia nuts to the mixture halfway through churning.
7. **Freeze**: Transfer to a container and freeze until firm.
