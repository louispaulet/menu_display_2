## Ingredients:
- 1 lobe of foie gras (approximately 500g)
- 2 tbsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp freshly ground white pepper
- 1 tbsp Cognac
- 4 sheets of 24-karat edible gold leaf
- 10g fresh black truffles

## Equipment Needed:
- Cheesecloth or plastic wrap
- Twine
- Sharp knife
- Truffle shaver or mandoline
- Offset spatula
- Food-safe tweezers

## Instructions:

### Foie Gras Preparation:
1. **Clean the Foie Gras**: Carefully separate the foie gras into its natural lobes. Using a small knife, remove any veins and dark spots. Be gentle to preserve its shape.

2. **Season the Foie Gras**: Lay the foie gras on a work surface. Sprinkle with kosher salt, sugar, and white pepper on all sides. Drizzle with Cognac and lightly massage into the lobes.

3. **Wrap and Form**: Lay a double layer of cheesecloth or plastic wrap on the work surface. Place the seasoned foie gras in the center. Roll tightly into a cylinder (torchon) shape, ensuring there are no air pockets. Twist the ends and tie securely with twine.

4. **Chill**: Place the wrapped torchon in the refrigerator for at least 2 days to allow flavors to develop. Turn occasionally to ensure even seasoning.

### Serving:
1. **Unwrap the Torchon**: Carefully remove the wrapping. Using a sharp knife, slice the torchon into half-inch thick medallions. Clean the knife between cuts to maintain clean edges.

2. **Apply the Gold Leaf**: With tweezers, delicately apply 24-karat gold leaf to one side of each foie gras medallion.

3. **Shave the Truffles**: Use a truffle shaver or mandoline to slice fresh truffles paper-thin.

4. **Assembly**: Arrange the foie gras medallions on serving spoons or small plates. Garnish with a few shavings of black truffle on top of each.

5. **Final Touch**: Serve immediately alongside a chilled glass of Dom Pérignon Vintage 2015 to draw out the nuanced flavors of the dish.
