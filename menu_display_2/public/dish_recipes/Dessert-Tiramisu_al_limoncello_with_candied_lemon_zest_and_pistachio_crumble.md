### Ingredients

#### For the Tiramisu
- 1 cup (240 ml) limoncello
- 1 cup (240 ml) heavy cream
- 8 ounces (225 g) mascarpone cheese
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar
- 24 ladyfingers

#### For the Candied Lemon Zest
- 2 large lemons, zest peeled in strips
- 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar
- 1 cup (240 ml) water

#### For the Pistachio Crumble
- 1/2 cup (50 g) shelled pistachios
- 1/4 cup (30 g) all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons (25 g) granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons (30 g) cold unsalted butter, cubed

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Tiramisu
1. **Mix Limoncello:** In a shallow dish, pour the limoncello and set aside for soaking the ladyfingers.

2. **Whip the Cream:** In a large mixing bowl, beat the heavy cream to soft peaks. Set aside.

3. **Prepare Mascarpone Mixture:** In another bowl, whisk together mascarpone cheese, vanilla extract, and granulated sugar until smooth.

4. **Combine Cream and Mascarpone:** Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until fully combined.

5. **Assemble the Tiramisu:** Quickly dip each ladyfinger in the limoncello, allowing them to soak just enough to soften but not fall apart.
    - **Layer 1:** Arrange half of the soaked ladyfingers at the bottom of a serving dish.
    - **Layer 2:** Spread half of the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers.
    - **Repeat:** Add another layer of limoncello-soaked ladyfingers and finish with the remaining mascarpone cream.

6. **Chill the Tiramisu:** Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to set.

#### Make the Candied Lemon Zest
1. **Blanch the Zest:** Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Blanch the lemon zest for 1 minute. Drain and rinse under cold water.

2. **Candy the Zest:** Combine sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar dissolves. Add the lemon zest strips and simmer for 10-15 minutes until translucent.
   - **Dry the Zest:** Using a slotted spoon, transfer the zest to a wire rack to cool and harden.

#### Prepare the Pistachio Crumble
1. **Process Ingredients:** Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). In a food processor, combine pistachios, flour, sugar, and butter. Pulse until coarse crumbs form.

2. **Bake the Crumble:** Spread the crumb mixture on a baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes, stirring once until golden brown. Allow to cool completely.

### Serving
1. **Garnish and Serve:** Before serving, garnish the tiramisu with candied lemon zest and sprinkle pistachio crumble on top for a delightful crunch.

2. **Wine Pairing:** Serve with a chilled glass of Moscato d'Asti Vietti Cascinetta 2020 to enhance the citrusy notes of the dessert.
