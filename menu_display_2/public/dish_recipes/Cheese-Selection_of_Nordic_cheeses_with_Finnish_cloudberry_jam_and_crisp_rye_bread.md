- **Finnish Cloudberry Jam**

### Instructions:

#### Prepare the Crisp Rye Bread:
1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. **Mix Ingredients:** In a mixing bowl, combine rye flour, baking powder, salt, and caraway seeds, if using.
3. **Form Dough:** Gradually add cold water to the dry ingredients, stirring until a sticky dough forms.
4. **Roll Out:** Place the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll it out into a thin sheet. The thickness should be about 3mm.
5. **Bake:** Transfer the rolled dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush lightly with olive oil and bake in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes until crisp and golden.
6. **Cool:** Allow the baked rye bread to cool on a wire rack before breaking into pieces.

#### Make the Cloudberry Jam:
1. **Combine Ingredients:** Place cloudberries, sugar, and water in a saucepan over medium heat.
2. **Cook:** Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the berries have broken down and the mixture has thickened.
3. **Add Lemon Juice:** Stir in the lemon juice and cook for an additional 2 minutes.
4. **Cool and Jar:** Remove from heat and allow to cool. Transfer the jam into a jar and refrigerate until ready to serve.

#### Assemble the Dish:
1. **Arrange Cheeses:** On a cheese board or platter, arrange the selection of Nordic cheeses.
2. **Add Jam and Bread:** Serve with a small bowl of the Finnish cloudberry jam and the crisp rye bread.
3. **Pair:** Present alongside a chilled glass of Château Climens Barsac 2016 for a delightful pairing.

### Notes:
- **Cheese Selection Tips:** Allow cheeses to come to room temperature before serving for optimal flavor.
- **Cloudberry Jam:** If cloudberries aren't available, substitute with lingonberry or another berry jam.
- **Rye Bread:** For extra flavor, consider topping the crisp rye bread with sesame or poppy seeds before baking.
