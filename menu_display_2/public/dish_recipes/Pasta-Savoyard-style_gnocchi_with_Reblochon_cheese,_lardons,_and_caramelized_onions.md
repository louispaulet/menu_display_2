# Savoyard-Style Gnocchi with Reblochon Cheese, Lardons, and Caramelized Onions

This classic Alpine dish combines the creamy richness of Reblochon cheese with the savory notes of lardons and the sweetness of caramelized onions. Perfect for a comforting meal on a chilly evening.

## Ingredients

- 500g store-bought potato gnocchi or homemade gnocchi
- 250g Reblochon cheese, rind removed and cubed
- 150g lardons or pancetta, diced
- 2 large onions, thinly sliced
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves (optional)
- 1/4 cup chicken or vegetable stock (optional)
- Fresh parsley, finely chopped for garnish

## Directions

### Step 1: Caramelize the Onions

1. In a large skillet over medium heat, add the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter. Add the sliced onions with a pinch of salt.
2. Sauté the onions for about 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they become golden brown and caramelized. Be careful not to burn them. Add a splash of water if they begin to stick, to help them cook down.

### Step 2: Cook the Lardons

1. In a separate pan, brown the lardons over medium heat until they're crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove them and set aside, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.

### Step 3: Cook the Gnocchi

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi and cook according to package instructions, or until they float to the top if using homemade.
2. Drain the gnocchi and set aside.

### Step 4: Combine and Bake

1. Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In the skillet with the caramelized onions, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and melt it over low heat.
3. Add the cooked gnocchi and toss to coat in the butter and onions.
4. Stir in the crispy lardons, and if using, add the chicken or vegetable stock to help create a sauce.
5. Season the mixture with salt, pepper, and fresh thyme.
6. Transfer the mixture to a baking dish.
7. Distribute the cubed Reblochon evenly over the gnocchi.
8. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

### Step 5: Serve

1. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly.
2. Garnish with fresh parsley over the top before serving.
3. Pair with a glass of Louis Jadot Moulin-à-Vent 2018 to complement the flavors.

Enjoy your Savoyard-style gnocchi warm, with a delightful balance of rich and savory Alpine flavors!
