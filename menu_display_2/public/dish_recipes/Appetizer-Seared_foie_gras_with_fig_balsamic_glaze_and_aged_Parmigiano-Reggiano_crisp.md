## Seared Foie Gras with Fig Balsamic Glaze and Aged Parmigiano-Reggiano Crisp

### Ingredients:

#### For the Foie Gras:
- 4 slices of foie gras, about 1 inch thick
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

#### For the Fig Balsamic Glaze:
- ½ cup balsamic vinegar
- 3 tablespoons fig preserves
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

#### For the Parmigiano-Reggiano Crisp:
- 1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- Freshly ground black pepper

#### Garnish:
- Fresh figs, quartered
- Microgreens, optional

### Instructions:

#### Prepare the Parmigiano-Reggiano Crisp:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Spread grated Parmigiano-Reggiano into four separate circles (about 4 inches in diameter) on the parchment paper. Lightly season with freshly ground black pepper.
3. Bake for 5-6 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and golden brown. 
4. Let them cool on the sheet for a minute to harden before carefully transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

#### Make the Fig Balsamic Glaze:
1. In a small saucepan, combine the balsamic vinegar, fig preserves, honey, and lemon juice.
2. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Continue cooking until the glaze is reduced by half and thickened, about 8-10 minutes.
3. Season with freshly ground black pepper to taste and remove from heat. Set aside.

#### Cook the Foie Gras:
1. Season the foie gras slices generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides.
2. Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the butter and melt.
3. Place the foie gras slices in the skillet and sear for about 1-2 minutes on each side, until browned and crisp on the outside but still soft inside.
4. Remove from the skillet and let rest on a paper towel.

#### Assembly:
1. Place a Parmigiano-Reggiano crisp on each serving plate.
2. Top each crisp with a slice of seared foie gras.
3. Drizzle the fig balsamic glaze generously over the foie gras.
4. Garnish with fresh fig quarters and microgreens if using.

### Wine Pairing:
- Serve with a glass of Barolo Gaja Sperss 2016, which complements the rich flavors of the foie gras and enhances the sweet and tangy notes of the glaze.
