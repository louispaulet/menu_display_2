## Ingredients

- **Sushi Rice**
  - 2 cups sushi rice
  - 2 1/4 cups water
  - 1/4 cup rice vinegar
  - 2 tablespoons sugar
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt

- **Tuna**
  - 200 grams sushi-grade akami (lean cut of tuna)
  - Pinch of sea salt (optional, for seasoning)

- **Wasabi**
  - 1 tablespoon freshly grated wasabi (or high-quality ready-made wasabi paste)

- **To Serve**
  - Soy sauce, for dipping
  - Pickled ginger

## Equipment

- Rice cooker or heavy-bottomed pot
- Bamboo rolling mat (optional)
- Sharp sushi knife

## Instructions

### Preparing Sushi Rice

1. **Rinse the Rice:** Rinse the sushi rice with cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming gummy.

2. **Cook the Rice:** Add the rinsed sushi rice and measured water to a rice cooker. If cooking on a stove, bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer, covering tightly for about 20 minutes, until all water is absorbed.

3. **Season the Rice:** In a small saucepan over low heat, combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Stir until dissolved. Once the rice is done, transfer it to a large bowl and gently fold in the vinegar mixture using a wooden spoon or rice paddle. Allow it to cool to room temperature covered with a damp cloth.

### Preparing the Tuna

4. **Slice the Tuna:** Using a sharp sushi knife, slice the tuna against the grain into thin, even pieces about 1/4 inch thick and 2 inches long. For the perfect slice, aim for uniform thickness and elegance.

### Assembling the Nigiri

5. **Shape the Rice:** With slightly wet hands to prevent sticking, take about 2 tablespoons of sushi rice and shape into an oval-shaped mound using gentle pressure.

6. **Assemble Nigiri:** Add a dab of freshly grated wasabi atop each rice mound, then lay a slice of tuna over the rice. Press gently to allow the fish to adhere.

7. **Repeat:** Repeat with remaining ingredients until all rice or tuna slices are used.

### Presentation

8. **Plate the Nigiri:** Arrange the tuna nigiri on a serving platter. Serve immediately with a small dish of soy sauce and a small pile of pickled ginger on the side.

### Serving Suggestion

9. **Wine Pairing:** Pair each serving of nigiri with a glass of Kubota Senju Ginjo to enhance the clean flavors of the tuna and the wasabi's earthiness.

Enjoy this delicate and artful nigiri dish, celebrating the purity of akami tuna and the nuance of freshly grated wasabi.
