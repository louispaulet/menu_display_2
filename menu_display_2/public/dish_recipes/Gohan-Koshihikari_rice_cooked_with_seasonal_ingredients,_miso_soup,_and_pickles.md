- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon mirin
- 1/2 teaspoon dashi granules

#### Miso Soup
- 4 cups dashi stock (either homemade or from granules)
- 1/4 cup miso paste (white or red)
- 1/2 block silken tofu, cut into small cubes

#### Pickles

### Instructions

#### For the Gohan
1. **Prepare the Rice:** Rinse the Koshihikari rice in cold water until the water runs clear, then drain.
2. **Combine Ingredients:** In a rice cooker or saucepan, add the rinsed rice, water, soy sauce, mirin, and dashi granules. Mix well to combine.
3. **Add Vegetables:** Place julienned carrot, sliced shiitake mushrooms, and edamame on top of the rice. Do not stir.
4. **Cook:** Start the rice cooker and allow it to complete its regular cycle. If using a saucepan, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover with a lid, and simmer for 15-20 minutes until the water is absorbed.
5. **Rest and Fluff:** Once cooked, let the rice sit covered for an additional 10 minutes before fluffing with a rice paddle.

#### For the Miso Soup
1. **Heat Dashi Stock:** In a medium-sized pot, bring dashi stock to a gentle simmer.
2. **Add Tofu:** Gently add cubed silken tofu to the pot and warm through.
3. **Dissolve Miso Paste:** In a small bowl, mix a ladle of hot dashi with the miso paste to help dissolve it, then return the mixture to the pot.
4. **Add Seaweed:** Integrate the rehydrated wakame seaweed into the soup.
5. **Final Steps:** Just before serving, add sliced green onions.

#### For the Pickles
1. **Create Pickling Liquid:** In a small bowl, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt together until dissolved.
2. **Combine with Cucumber:** Add sliced cucumber to the pickling liquid and toss to coat.
3. **Chill:** Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld.

### Serving Suggestions
Serve the gohan warm, accompanied by miso soup and a small plate of pickles. Pair this dish with a glass of Hakkaisan Junmai Ginjo Sake to complement the subtle flavors of the rice and seasonal ingredients.

### Note
- Adjust the amount of miso paste in the soup according to the desired saltiness.
- Feel free to substitute or add seasonal vegetables as preferred in the gohan.
