**Wine Pairing:** Champagne Taittinger Brut Réserve

#### Ingredients

**For the Blinis:**
- 1/2 cup (65g) all-purpose flour  
- 1/4 cup (30g) buckwheat flour  
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder  
- 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt  
- 1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk  
- 1 large egg, separated  
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled  

**For the Toppings:**
- 4 ounces (115g) smoked salmon, thinly sliced  
- 1 ounce (30g) Ossetra caviar  
- 1/4 cup (60ml) crème fraîche  
- Fresh dill sprigs, for garnish  
- Freshly cracked black pepper, to taste  

#### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Blinis Batter:**
   - In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, buckwheat flour, baking powder, and salt.
   - In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk and egg yolk. Add the melted butter and stir until combined.
   - Gradually whisk the wet ingredients into the flour mixture until you obtain a smooth batter.

2. **Whisk the Egg White:**
   - In a clean bowl, whisk the egg white until soft peaks form.
   - Gently fold the whipped egg white into the blini batter, being careful not to deflate it too much.

3. **Cook the Blinis:**
   - Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat.
   - Lightly grease the surface with a small amount of butter.
   - Drop tablespoonfuls of batter onto the skillet, spacing them about 1-inch apart.
   - Cook until bubbles form on the surface, about 1-2 minutes, then flip and cook for another 1 minute until golden brown.
   - Transfer cooked blinis to a wire rack to cool slightly.

4. **Assemble the Amuse-Bouche:**
   - On each blini, place a small dollop of crème fraîche.
   - Gently fold a slice of smoked salmon and place it on top of the crème fraîche.
   - Add a small spoonful of Ossetra caviar atop the salmon.
   - Garnish with a sprig of fresh dill and a light sprinkle of freshly cracked black pepper.

5. **Serve Immediately:**
   - Arrange the prepared blinis on a serving platter and immediately serve alongside glasses of Champagne Taittinger Brut Réserve for a sparkling start to any occasion.
