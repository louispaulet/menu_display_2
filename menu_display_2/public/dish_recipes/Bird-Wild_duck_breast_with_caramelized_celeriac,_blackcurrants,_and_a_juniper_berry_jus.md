### For the Caramelized Celeriac
- 1 medium celeriac, peeled and cut into small cubes
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- Salt and pepper to taste

### For the Blackcurrants
- 100g fresh blackcurrants, washed and drained
- 1 tablespoon sugar

### For the Juniper Berry Jus
- 200ml red wine
- 200ml high-quality chicken stock
- 1 tablespoon juniper berries, crushed
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar

## Instructions

### Preparing the Duck
1. Preheat your oven to 200°C (390°F).
2. Score the skin on the duck breasts in a criss-cross pattern, being careful not to cut into the meat.
3. Season both sides of the duck with salt and pepper.
4. Heat a wide ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat and add the vegetable oil.
5. Place the duck breasts skin-side down in the skillet and sear until the skin is golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes.
6. Flip the breasts and transfer the skillet to the oven. Roast for 4-6 minutes for medium rare, depending on the size of the breasts.
7. Remove from the oven, and let the duck rest on a cutting board for at least 5 minutes before slicing.

### Caramelizing the Celeriac
1. Heat butter and olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.
2. Add the cubed celeriac and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to soften and brown, about 8 minutes.
3. Sprinkle with sugar and continue to cook until caramelized and tender, approximately 5 more minutes.
4. Season with salt and pepper, then set aside and keep warm.

### Cooking the Blackcurrants
1. In a small saucepan, combine blackcurrants and sugar over medium heat.
2. Cook until the blackcurrants are just softened and coated in their own syrup, approximately 5 minutes.
3. Set aside to cool slightly.

### Making the Juniper Berry Jus
1. In the same pan you cooked the duck, pour off excess fat, leaving about a tablespoon to sauté the shallots.
2. Add the shallots and cook over medium heat until translucent, about 2 minutes.
3. Pour in the red wine and add crushed juniper berries. Increase the heat and bring to a boil.
4. Reduce the wine by half, then add the chicken stock and balsamic vinegar.
5. Continue to boil the mixture until it thickens to a syrupy consistency.
6. Strain the sauce, return to the pan, and whisk in butter for a glossy finish. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

## Plating
1. Slice the rested duck breasts thinly against the grain.
2. Arrange the celeriac on warmed plates, lay sliced duck over it.
3. Spoon the blackcurrants neatly beside the duck.
4. Drizzle the juniper berry jus over and around the duck.
5. Serve immediately with a glass of Georges Vernay Côte-Rôtie Blonde du Seigneur 2018 to complement the dish's richness and complexity.
