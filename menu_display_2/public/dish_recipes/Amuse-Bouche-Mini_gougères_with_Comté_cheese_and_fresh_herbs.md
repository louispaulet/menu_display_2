# Mini Gougères with Comté Cheese and Fresh Herbs

### Ingredients
- **125 ml** water
- **60 g** unsalted butter, cubed
- **Pinch** of salt
- **75 g** all-purpose flour
- **2** large eggs
- **75 g** Comté cheese, finely grated
- **1 tbsp** fresh chives, finely chopped
- **1 tbsp** fresh parsley, finely chopped
- **1/4 tsp** freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 220°C (428°F) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. **Prepare the Choux Pastry:**
   - In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine water, butter, and salt. Stir occasionally until the butter has melted and the mixture is at a gentle boil.
   - Remove from heat and add the flour all at once, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan.
   - Return the pan to low heat and cook for about 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, to dry out the dough slightly. It should leave a film on the bottom of the pan.

3. **Incorporate the Eggs:**
   - Transfer the dough to a mixing bowl and let it cool for a couple of minutes.
   - Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. The dough should be smooth and shiny, with a pipeable consistency.

4. **Add Cheese and Herbs:**
   - Stir in the grated Comté cheese, chopped chives, parsley, and black pepper until well combined.

5. **Pipe the Gougères:**
   - Spoon the choux dough into a piping bag fitted with a large plain nozzle. Pipe small mounds (about 2-3 cm in diameter) onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 5 cm apart.

6. **Bake the Gougères:**
   - Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes at 220°C (428°F).
   - Without opening the oven door, reduce the temperature to 180°C (356°F) and continue baking for another 15-20 minutes, or until the gougères are puffed and golden brown.

7. **Serve and Enjoy:**
   - Remove the gougères from the oven and let them cool slightly on a wire rack.
   - Serve warm as a delicate amuse-bouche, ideally accompanied by a glass of chilled Champagne Bollinger Special Cuvée Brut.

### Notes
- **Make Ahead:** The gougères can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container. Reheat in a 180°C (356°F) oven for a few minutes before serving to refresh their crispness.

- **Alternative Herbs:** Feel free to experiment with other herbs such as thyme or rosemary to add different flavors to your gougères.
