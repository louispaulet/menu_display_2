### Directions

#### To Prepare the Walnut Bread:

1. **Mixing the Dough:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast.
   - Gradually add the warm water and milk, mixing until a dough forms.
   - Knead the dough for 10 minutes on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic.

2. **Incorporating Walnuts:**
   - Gradually knead in the toasted walnut pieces into the dough until evenly distributed.

3. **First Rise:**
   - Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.

4. **Shaping and Second Rise:**
   - Punch the dough down and shape it into a loaf.
   - Place the shaped dough in a greased loaf pan or on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
   - Cover and let it rise again for about 30 minutes.

5. **Baking:**
   - Preheat the oven to 220°C (430°F).
   - Bake the loaf for 25-30 minutes or until it sounds hollow when tapped.
   - Let it cool on a wire rack before slicing.

#### To Prepare the Truffle Honey:

1. **Infusing the Honey:**
   - If using a whole black truffle, thinly slice or grate the truffle.
   - Gently warm the honey in a small saucepan over low heat.
   - Add the truffle slices or truffle oil to the honey, stirring gently to combine.
   - Allow the mixture to infuse for at least 15 minutes.

### To Serve:

1. **Arrange the Cheese:**
   - On a large cheese board, arrange your selection of French cheeses.
   - Consider arranging from mildest to strongest flavors.

2. **Accompaniments:**
   - Slice the cooled walnut bread into thick pieces and arrange alongside the cheeses.
   - Serve the truffle honey in a small dish with a drizzle spoon.

3. **Wine Pairing:**
   - Serve with a chilled bottle of Château d'Yquem 1999, which complements the creamy textures and delicate flavors of the cheeses and honey.

### Tips:
- Let the cheeses come to room temperature before serving to enhance their flavors.
- Adjust the cheese selections based on availability and personal preference.
