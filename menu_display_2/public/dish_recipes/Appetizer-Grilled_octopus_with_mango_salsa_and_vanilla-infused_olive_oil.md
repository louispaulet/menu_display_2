---

#### Ingredients:

**For the Grilled Octopus:**
- 1.5 lbs octopus, cleaned
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
- Salt, to taste

**For the Mango Salsa:**
- 1 ripe mango, peeled and diced
- 1 medium red bell pepper, diced
- 1 medium red onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1 jalapeño, seeded and minced
- Juice of 1 lime
- Salt and pepper, to taste

**For the Vanilla-infused Olive Oil:**
- 1/2 cup high-quality extra virgin olive oil
- 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped

#### Instructions:

**1. Preparing the Octopus:**
- In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the lemon slices, garlic cloves, bay leaf, peppercorns, and a generous pinch of salt.
- Add the octopus to the boiling water, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until tender. Remove from heat and let cool in the cooking liquid.
- Once cooled, cut the octopus tentacles into serving portions.

**2. Grilling the Octopus:**
- Preheat the grill to high heat. Lightly oil the grill grates to prevent sticking.
- Grill the octopus tentacles for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until charred and hot.
- Remove from the grill and set aside.

**3. Preparing the Mango Salsa:**
- In a medium bowl, combine diced mango, red bell pepper, red onion, cilantro, and jalapeño.
- Add lime juice and stir gently to combine. Season with salt and pepper, adjusting to taste.

**4. Vanilla-infused Olive Oil:**
- In a small saucepan, warm the olive oil over low heat.
- Add the vanilla bean seeds and the pod to the oil, allowing the vanilla essence to infuse over gentle heat for about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, then strain to remove the vanilla pod.

**5. Serving:**
- Arrange the grilled octopus tentacles on a serving platter.
- Spoon the mango salsa generously over the octopus.
- Drizzle the vanilla-infused olive oil over the dish for a fragrant finish.
- Garnish with additional cilantro if desired. Serve immediately with a chilled glass of Dog Point Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc 2020.
