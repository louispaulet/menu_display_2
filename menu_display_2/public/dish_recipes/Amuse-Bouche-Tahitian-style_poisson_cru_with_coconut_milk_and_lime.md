#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Fish:**
   - Cut the ahi tuna into small, uniform cubes (approximately 1 cm) to allow even marination.

2. **Marinate the Fish:**
   - Place the tuna cubes in a non-reactive bowl.
   - Pour the freshly squeezed lime juice over the fish.
   - Gently toss the fish to ensure all pieces are well-coated. Let it marinate in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. This will lightly "cook" the exterior while keeping the inside tender.

3. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - While the fish is marinating, prepare your vegetables: deseed and finely dice the cucumber and tomato, finely chop the red onion. If using chili, slice finely.

4. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Remove the fish from the refrigerator, drain excess lime juice, and gently mix in the diced cucumber, tomato, red onion, sliced chili (if using), and cilantro.
   - Add the coconut milk, salt, and pepper to taste, mixing delicately to combine. If using, add coconut oil for a richer flavor profile.

5. **Chill and Serve:**
   - Chill the poisson cru for another 10 minutes to let the flavors meld.
   - Adjust the seasoning before serving if necessary.

6. **Plating:**
   - Spoon a small portion of the poisson cru onto a chilled serving spoon or amuse-bouche glass.
   - Garnish each serving with a cilantro leaf, a sliver of lime wedge, and a sprinkle of toasted coconut flakes.

#### Wine Pairing:
- Serve with a glass of **Château d'Esclans Whispering Angel Rosé 2020**. Its crisp, refreshing qualities beautifully complement the tropical flavors of the dish.
