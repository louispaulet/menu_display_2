## Ingredients

### For the Biryani:
- 2 cups Basmati rice
- 500g young green jackfruit (canned or fresh)
- 3 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil
- 2 large onions, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 3 green cardamom pods
- 4 cloves
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 2 teaspoons garam masala
- 1 teaspoon cumin powder
- 1 teaspoon coriander powder
- 1 ½ cups plain yogurt
- 1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
- Salt to taste
- 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro leaves
- 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh mint leaves

### For the Saffron-Infused Basmati Rice:
- A pinch of saffron threads
- 1 tablespoon warm milk
- 4 cups water
- Salt, to taste

### Garnish:
- Fried cashews or almonds
- Raisins


## Instructions

### Preparing the Rice:
1. Rinse the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak in cold water for 30 minutes, then drain.
2. Boil 4 cups of water in a large pot, add salt, and cook the rice until 70% done. The rice should still have a bite to it. Drain the water and spread the rice on a tray to cool.
3. Dissolve saffron threads in warm milk and set aside.

### Preparing the Jackfruit Biryani:
1. If using canned jackfruit, drain it, rinse well, and pat dry. For fresh jackfruit, peel and cut into large chunks.
2. Heat ghee or oil in a heavy-bottom pot. Add the cumin seeds, cinnamon, cardamom pods, and cloves. Fry until aromatic.
3. Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown. Remove half of the onions for garnishing.
4. Add minced ginger and garlic, sauté for 2-3 minutes.
5. Add jackfruit pieces. Sprinkle with turmeric powder, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, and red chili powder. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the jackfruit is lightly browned.
6. Lower the heat, add yogurt, salt, and mix well. Cook for another 10 minutes till the oil separates.

### Layering and Cooking:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Using the same pot, layer the rice over the jackfruit mixture. Sprinkle with the saffron-infused milk, chopped cilantro, and mint leaves.
3. Cover with a tight-fitting lid or foil. Place in the oven for 20-25 minutes.

### Charring the Rice (Optional):
- For an additional smoky flavor, use a small piece of charcoal. Light the charcoal, place it in a bowl within the pot, and cover the top. Allow the biryani to infuse for a further 10 minutes.

### Serving:
1. Once cooked, gently fluff the biryani with a fork.
2. Garnish with fried onions, nuts, and raisins.
3. Serve hot with your choice of raita or salad.
