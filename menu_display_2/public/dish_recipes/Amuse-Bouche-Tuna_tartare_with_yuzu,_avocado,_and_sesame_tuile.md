3. Stir in the black and white sesame seeds and salt.
4. Spoon small rounds of the sesame mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, spreading them thinly into circles about 7cm in diameter.
5. Bake for 7-9 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.
6. Remove from oven and let cool on the baking sheet to crisp up.

**Assemble the Amuse-Bouche:**
1. In small serving dishes or spoons, place a spoonful of tuna tartare.
2. Top with a small spoonful of the avocado.
3. Garnish with black sesame seeds.
4. Add a sesame tuile as a final touch.

**Wine Pairing:**
