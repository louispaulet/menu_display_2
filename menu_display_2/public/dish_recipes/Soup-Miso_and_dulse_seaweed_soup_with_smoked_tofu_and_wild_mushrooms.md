### Miso and Dulse Seaweed Soup with Smoked Tofu and Wild Mushrooms

**Servings:** 4

#### Ingredients:
- **For the Soup Base:**
  - 4 cups vegetable broth
  - 2 tablespoons white miso paste
  - 2 tablespoons dulse seaweed
  - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
  - 1 teaspoon sesame oil

- **For the Garnish:**
  - 200g smoked tofu, cubed
  - 150g wild mushrooms (such as shiitake and oyster), sliced
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 2 scallions, thinly sliced
  - 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
  - Fresh coriander leaves, for garnish 

#### Preparation:

1. **Prepare the Soup Base:**
   - In a medium-sized pot, bring the vegetable broth to a gentle simmer. Add the white miso paste by dissolving it in a small amount of hot broth in a separate bowl, then add it back to the pot.
   - Stir in the dulse seaweed, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Allow the flavors to meld over low heat, simmering for about 10 minutes.
   
2. **Cook the Garnish:**
   - In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the sliced wild mushrooms and sauté until golden and tender, about 5-7 minutes.
   - Add the cubed smoked tofu to the skillet and cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing it to warm through and absorb some mushroom flavor.

3. **Assemble the Soup:**
   - Divide the cooked mushrooms and smoked tofu among four bowls.
   - Ladle the hot miso-dulse broth over the contents in each bowl.

4. **Serve:**
   - Top each serving with thinly sliced scallions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.
   - Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
   
5. **Pairing Suggestion:**
   - Serve with a chilled glass of Gruner Veltliner Hirsch Kammern Heiligenstein 2018, which complements the umami flavors beautifully.

#### Chef’s Tip:
- For a richer flavor, consider using dried shiitake mushrooms in the broth base and rehydrate them along with the seaweed.
- To enhance smokiness, briefly grill the tofu before adding it to the soup.
