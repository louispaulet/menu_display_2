## Method

### Prepare the Terrine
1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. **Cook Vegetables**: In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add ginger and sauté until fragrant. Add sliced daikon and carrots, season with salt and pepper, and cook gently until slightly tender, about 10 minutes.
3. **Layer Terrine**: Line a small loaf pan with parchment paper. Begin layering the cooked daikon and carrot slices, alternating layers for color contrast.
4. **Bake**: Cover with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes until vegetables are tender.
5. **Chill and Set**: Remove from oven, press lightly to remove air gaps. Allow to cool and set in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or overnight for better texture.

### Herbed Tofu Cream
1. **Blend Ingredients**: In a blender or food processor, combine tofu, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, chives, and parsley. Blend until smooth and creamy, season with salt and pepper.
2. **Chill**: Transfer to a bowl, cover with cling film, and refrigerate until ready to serve.

### Ponzu Sauce
1. **Mix Ingredients**: In a bowl, combine soy sauce, lemon juice, mirin, rice vinegar, dashi, and sugar. Whisk until the sugar is dissolved and everything is well combined.

## Assembly
1. **Slice Terrine**: Carefully remove the terrine from the loaf pan and slice it into equal portions.
2. **Plate**: Place each terrine slice on a serving plate.
3. **Add Tofu Cream**: Add a spoonful of herbed tofu cream beside each slice.
4. **Drizzle Sauces**: Drizzle ponzu sauce over the terrine slices.
5. **Garnish**: Finish with microgreens or fresh herbs for garnish.
