### Instructions

#### Step 1: Prepare the Potato Layer
1. **Cook the Potatoes:** In a large pot, cover the diced potatoes with cold water and bring them to a boil. Cook for about 20 minutes, or until tender.
2. **Drain and Mash:** Drain the potatoes and mash them while hot until smooth and creamy.
3. **Season the Potatoes:** Add the aji amarillo paste, lime juice, olive oil, salt, and white pepper. Mix until fully incorporated. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.

#### Step 2: Prepare the Crab Salad
1. **Mix the Ingredients:** In a large bowl, combine the crab meat, mayonnaise, celery, red onion, lime juice, and chopped cilantro.
2. **Season:** Add salt and pepper to taste and mix gently to avoid breaking the crab meat.

#### Step 3: Assemble the Causa
1. **First Layer:** Using a ring mold on a serving plate, spread half of the aji amarillo potato mixture evenly at the bottom.
2. **Second Layer:** Add the crab salad layer, gently pressing down with the back of a spoon to ensure it's compact.
3. **Third Layer:** Place the remaining aji amarillo potato mixture on top, smoothing it with a spoon.
4. **Chill:** Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld and the causa to firm up.

#### Step 4: Garnish and Serve
1. **Unmold the Causa:** Lift the ring mold carefully.
2. **Add Garnishes:** Arrange avocado slices and hard-boiled egg slices on top. Sprinkle chopped red chili and fresh cilantro leaves for color and an extra hint of flavor.
3. **Serve with Lime:** Accompany with lime wedges for added zest.
