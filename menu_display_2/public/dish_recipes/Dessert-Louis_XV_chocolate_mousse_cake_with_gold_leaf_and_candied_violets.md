## Instructions

### To Make the Hazelnut Dacquoise:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar, beating until stiff, glossy peaks form.
3. Gently fold in the ground hazelnuts and flour using a spatula.
4. Spread the mixture evenly into a circle, about 8 inches in diameter, on the prepared baking sheet.
5. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until light golden brown. Let cool completely.

### To Make the Chocolate Mousse:
1. In a heatproof bowl, melt the chopped chocolate, milk, and butter over simmering water, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
2. Stir the yolks into the chocolate mixture.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form.
4. In another bowl, whip the heavy cream to soft peaks.
5. Gradually fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture until well combined.
6. Gently fold in the beaten egg whites until no streaks remain.
7. Pour the mousse over the cooled dacquoise and smooth the top with a spatula. Refrigerate until set, about 3 hours.

### To Make the Chocolate Glaze:
1. In a small saucepan, combine the heavy cream, sugar, and corn syrup. Bring just to a boil.
2. Remove from heat and pour over the chopped chocolate. Let sit for a minute, then stir until smooth.
3. Allow the glaze to cool until slightly thickened but still pourable.
4. Pour the glaze over the set mousse, letting it evenly coat the top.
5. Refrigerate briefly to set the glaze.

### To Serve:
1. Carefully transfer the cake to a serving platter.
2. Decorate with edible gold leaf and candied violets.
3. Serve chilled, paired with a glass of Château Climens Barsac 2017.
