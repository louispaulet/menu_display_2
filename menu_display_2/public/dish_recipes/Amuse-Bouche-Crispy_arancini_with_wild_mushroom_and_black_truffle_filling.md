## Ingredients

### For the Risotto:
- 1 cup Arborio rice
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 3 cups chicken or vegetable stock, kept warm
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### For the Filling:
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 cup wild mushrooms, cleaned and finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
- 1 tablespoon black truffle oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### For Breading and Frying:
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 1 cup panko breadcrumbs
- Vegetable oil, for frying

## Instructions

### Make the Risotto:
1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes.
2. Add Arborio rice to the pan, stirring to coat with oil, and lightly toast for 1–2 minutes.
3. Pour in the white wine, stirring until absorbed by the rice.
4. Add warm stock, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and allowing liquid to be absorbed before adding more.
5. Once the rice is creamy and tender, remove from heat and stir in butter and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.
6. Season risotto with salt and pepper, and spread onto a baking sheet to cool completely.

### Prepare the Filling:
1. In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and cook until they are golden brown and have released most of their moisture.
2. Add minced garlic and thyme, cooking until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Add truffle oil, stir to combine, and season with salt and pepper.
4. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool slightly.

### Assemble the Arancini:
1. Once risotto is cooled, take a tablespoon of rice in the palm of your hand, flatten it slightly, and place a small spoonful of mushroom filling in the center.
2. Encase the filling with another tablespoon of risotto and roll into a ball, ensuring the filling is completely enclosed.
3. Repeat until all the risotto and filling are used.

### Bread and Fry:
1. Set up a breading station with flour, beaten eggs, and panko in separate shallow bowls.
2. Roll each risotto ball first in flour, then in egg, and finally in panko.
3. Heat vegetable oil in a deep saucepan to 350°F (175°C).
4. Fry arancini in batches until golden brown and crispy, about 3–4 minutes per batch.
5. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

### Serve:
- Plate the crispy arancini, and serve immediately alongside a glass of Franciacorta, for a luxurious and indulgent amuse-bouche.
