### Bò lúc lắc - Shaking Beef

A vibrant and flavorful Vietnamese dish featuring tender cubes of marinated beef, paired with crisp fresh watercress, fragrant garlic, and tangy pickled onions.

#### Ingredients:

**For the Beef Marinade:**
- 500g (1 lb) ribeye or sirloin steak, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon rice wine or dry sherry

**For the Garlic and Onions:**
- 1 large red onion, thinly sliced
- 3 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- A pinch of salt
- 6 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (for frying)
- 1 small bunch of watercress, washed and trimmed

**For Serving:**
- Jasmine rice, cooked according to package instructions
- Lime wedges

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Marinade:**  
   - In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce, sugar, black pepper, vegetable oil, and rice wine. 
   - Add the beef cubes to the marinade, tossing well to coat. Cover and let marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours in the refrigerator.

2. **Pickle the Onion:**  
   - In a small bowl, mix together rice vinegar, sugar, and a pinch of salt until dissolved. 
   - Add the sliced red onion and let sit for at least 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain before serving.

3. **Cook the Beef:**
   - Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. 
   - Add the marinated beef cubes, spreading them out into a single layer. Allow them to sear undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until well-browned on one side.
   - Stir and cook for another 2-3 minutes until browned on all sides and just cooked through. Remove the beef onto a plate.

4. **Sauté the Garlic:**
   - In the same skillet, add the sliced garlic and quickly stir-fry until golden and aromatic, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat.

5. **Plating:**
   - On a serving platter, arrange a bed of fresh watercress. 
   - Place the shaking beef over the watercress and scatter with the sautéed garlic.
   - Top with the drained pickled onions.
   - Serve with steamed jasmine rice and lime wedges on the side.

6. **Wine Pairing:**
   - Enjoy this dish with a glass of Syrah E. Guigal Crozes-Hermitage 2017, which complements the bold flavors of the beef and the tangy onions.
