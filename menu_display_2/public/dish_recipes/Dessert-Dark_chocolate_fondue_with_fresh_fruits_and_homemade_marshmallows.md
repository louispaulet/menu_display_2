### Ingredients

#### For the Chocolate Fondue
- 300g dark chocolate (70% cocoa), finely chopped
- 200ml heavy cream
- 50ml whole milk
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of sea salt

#### For Homemade Marshmallows
- 3 packets unflavored gelatin (about 21g)
- 1 cup cold water, divided
- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
- 1 cup light corn syrup
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- Cornstarch and powdered sugar, for dusting

#### For Serving

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Chocolate Fondue:
1. **Melt Chocolate:** In a heatproof bowl, combine dark chocolate, heavy cream, milk, butter, and honey. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) and whisk constantly until the chocolate is melted and smooth.
2. **Add Flavorings:** Remove from the heat, stir in vanilla extract and a pinch of sea salt. Keep warm while preparing other elements.

#### Make Homemade Marshmallows:
1. **Bloom Gelatin:** In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine gelatin and 1/2 cup cold water. Allow it to sit and bloom for 10 minutes.
2. **Cook Sugar Syrup:** In a medium saucepan, combine granulated sugar, corn syrup, the remaining 1/2 cup of water, and salt. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture reaches 240°F (115°C) on a candy thermometer.
3. **Combine Ingredients:** Once the sugar reaches the correct temperature, slowly pour it into the gelatin mixture with the mixer on low speed.
4. **Whip Marshmallow:** Increase the mixer speed to high and continue beating until the mixture becomes thick and tripled in volume, about 10-15 minutes. Beat in vanilla extract.
5. **Setting:** Generously dust a square baking pan with a mixture of powdered sugar and cornstarch. Pour the marshmallow mixture into the pan and spread evenly. Dust the top with the sugar-cornstarch mix.
6. **Cut Marshmallows:** Let it sit at room temperature for at least 4 hours or until firm. Once set, cut the marshmallow into squares with a sharp knife dusted in powdered sugar.

### Serve:
1. Pour warm chocolate fondue into a deep bowl or a fondue pot.
2. Arrange fresh fruits, homemade marshmallows, and small skewers on a serving platter around the fondue.
3. Enjoy by dipping the fruits and marshmallows into the rich, warm chocolate sauce.

### Wine Pairing:
For an exquisite pairing, serve with a glass of Eiswein Domaine des Muses 2017. Its sweet and slightly acidic profile will complement the richness of the chocolate and the freshness of the fruit.
