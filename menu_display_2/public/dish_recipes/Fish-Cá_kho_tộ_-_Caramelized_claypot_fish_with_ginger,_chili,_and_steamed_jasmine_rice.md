## Cá Kho Tộ - Caramelized Claypot Fish with Ginger, Chili, and Steamed Jasmine Rice

### Ingredients

#### For the Caramelized Fish
- 500g (1 lb) catfish, tuna, or mackerel, cut into steaks
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce
- 3 tablespoons water
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch piece ginger, sliced thinly into julienne strips
- 3-4 green onions, cut into 2-inch lengths
- 1-2 red bird's eye chilies, chopped
- 1 small shallot, thinly sliced
- Freshly ground black pepper

#### For the Steamed Jasmine Rice
- 2 cups jasmine rice
- 4 cups water

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Fish Marinade
1. Rinse the fish steaks under cold water; pat dry with a paper towel.
2. In a large bowl, mix the fish with salt and pepper. Set aside for 10 minutes.

#### Caramelize the Fish
1. In a claypot or a deep saucepan over medium heat, add sugar and 3 tablespoons of water. Stir gently until the sugar dissolves and takes on a deep amber color. This will take around 5-7 minutes.
2. Quickly add the fish sauce and oil to the caramel, then allow it to cook for another minute.
3. Add the minced garlic, shallot, and ginger. Stir gently to mix well with the caramel sauce.
4. Place the fish steaks in the pot, ensuring each piece is coated with the caramel sauce.
5. Add a few tablespoons of water to cover the fish halfway.
6. Sprinkle chopped chili and green onions over the fish.
7. Allow the fish to simmer on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, occasionally spooning the sauce over the fish to enhance flavor. Adjust seasoning if necessary.
8. Once the sauce is thick and glossy, remove the pot from heat.

#### While fish is cooking, prepare the Steamed Jasmine Rice
1. Rinse jasmine rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.
2. Combine the rice and water in a pot.
3. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cover the pot.
4. Cook for about 12-15 minutes until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.
5. Remove from heat and let it sit covered for an additional 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork.

### Presentation
