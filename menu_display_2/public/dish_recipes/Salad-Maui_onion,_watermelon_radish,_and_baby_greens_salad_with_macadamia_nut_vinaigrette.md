#### Chef's Tips:
- If Maui onions are unavailable, sweet Vidalia onions are a great substitute.
- To enhance the flavor of the macadamia nuts, you can lightly toast them in a dry skillet over medium heat, tossing occasionally until golden brown.
- Experiment with additional toppers like sliced avocados or pomegranate seeds for added color and taste.
