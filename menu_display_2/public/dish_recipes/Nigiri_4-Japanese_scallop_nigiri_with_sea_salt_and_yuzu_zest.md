### Ingredients

- **Sushi Rice**
  - 2 cups sushi rice
  - 2 cups water
  - 1/4 cup rice vinegar
  - 2 tablespoons sugar
  - 1 tablespoon salt

- **Scallops**
  - 8 fresh large scallops (preferably Japanese hotate)
  
- **Garnish**
  - Pinch of high-quality sea salt
  - Zest of 1 yuzu (or substitute with lime if unavailable)

- **Servings**
  - 8 pieces of nigiri

### Instructions

#### Preparing Sushi Rice
1. **Rinse the Rice:**
   - Rinse sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.
2. **Cook the Rice:**
   - Add the rinsed rice and water to a rice cooker. Cook according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. **Season the Rice:**
   - As the rice cooks, combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan. Heat gently, stirring until sugar and salt dissolve. Do not let it boil.
4. **Mix the Rice:**
   - Once rice is cooked, transfer it to a large non-metallic bowl, and gently fold the vinegar mixture into the rice. Use a cutting and folding motion with a rice paddle to blend. Fan the rice to cool and give it shine. Cover with a damp cloth until ready to use.

#### Preparing Scallop Nigiri
5. **Slice the Scallops:**
   - Slice each scallop in half horizontally to form two thinner discs.
6. **Shape the Rice:**
   - Wet hands with vinegar water to prevent sticking. Take about 3 tablespoons of sushi rice and shape it into an oval, pressing lightly to ensure it holds its shape.
7. **Assemble Nigiri:**
   - Place a scallop slice over the shaped rice, pressing gently to adhere. Repeat for all pieces.
8. **Garnish:**
   - Sprinkle a tiny pinch of sea salt on each scallop, then zest the yuzu lightly over the top of each piece.

### Serving
- Arrange the finished nigiri pieces on a serving platter. Ideally, serve immediately to ensure the freshest taste and texture.
- Pair with a chilled glass of Kubota Senju Ginjo to complement the sweet brininess of the scallops.

### Tips
- Always use the freshest scallops available for the best flavor.
- Adjust the amount of yuzu zest to personal preference for a more pronounced citrus aroma.
- Drinking the Kubota Senju Ginjo enhances the overall experience by cutting through the richness with its crisp profile.
