#### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Hazelnuts:**
   - Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and roast in the oven for 10-12 minutes until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let them cool before roughly chopping.

2. **Make the Champagne Vinaigrette:**
   - In a small bowl, whisk together the champagne vinegar, Dijon mustard, and honey until well combined.
   - Slowly drizzle in the extra virgin olive oil while continuously whisking until the vinaigrette is emulsified.
   - Season the vinaigrette with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

3. **Assemble the Salad:**
   - In a large salad bowl, combine the young spinach leaves, shaved fennel, and roasted hazelnuts.
   - Drizzle the champagne vinaigrette over the salad and gently toss to mix well and coat the ingredients evenly.

4. **Garnish and Serve:**
   - Transfer the salad to individual plates or a serving platter.
   - Garnish with fresh dill sprigs for added freshness and a hint of anise flavor.

#### Wine Pairing

### Chef's Notes
- For extra depth in flavor, consider adding shaved parmesan cheese on top before serving.
- If you're not a fan of hazelnuts, toasted almonds work wonderfully as a substitute. 
- Make sure to adjust the seasoning to your preference before serving, as the balance of flavors is key in a dish as delicate as this.
