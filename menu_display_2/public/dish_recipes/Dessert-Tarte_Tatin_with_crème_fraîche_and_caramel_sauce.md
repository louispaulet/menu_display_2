# Tarte Tatin with Crème Fraîche and Caramel Sauce

A delectably irresistible dessert that combines buttery, caramelized apples with flaky pastry, served with a dollop of crème fraîche and a drizzle of rich caramel sauce.

## Ingredients:

### For the Tarte Tatin:
- **6 medium apples** (such as Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, or Fuji)
- **100g (7 tablespoons) unsalted butter**
- **150g (3/4 cup) caster sugar**
- **1 sheet puff pastry**
- **Flour for dusting**
- **Pinch of salt**

### For the Caramel Sauce:
- **200g (1 cup) granulated sugar**
- **120ml (1/2 cup) heavy cream**
- **60g (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter**
- **Pinch of sea salt**

### To Serve:
- **Crème fraîche**

## Instructions:

### Preparing the Tarte Tatin:
1. **Preheat the Oven:**
    - Preheat the oven to 190°C (375°F).

2. **Prepare the Apples:**
    - Peel, core, and quarter the apples.
    - Melt the butter over medium heat in a large ovenproof skillet.

3. **Caramelize:**
    - Add the caster sugar to the skillet, stirring occasionally until it melts and turns golden brown.
    - Carefully place the apple quarters into the caramel in a circular pattern.
    - Cook the apples in the caramel for about 10 minutes, gently turning them to ensure even cooking and caramelization on all sides.

4. **Arrange and Cook:**
    - Remove the skillet from heat. Carefully arrange the apple quarters tightly in the skillet; they'll reduce in size as they cook.

5. **Prepare the Pastry:**
    - On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry slightly.
    - Trim the pastry into a circle just larger than the skillet.

6. **Assemble the Tarte:**
    - Place the puff pastry over the apples, tucking the edges into the sides of the skillet.

7. **Bake:**
    - Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven.
    - Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and puffed.

8. **Cool and Invert:**
    - Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes.
    - Carefully invert the tart onto a serving plate.

### Making the Caramel Sauce:
1. **Cook the Sugar:**
    - In a saucepan, heat the sugar over medium heat, stirring consistently, until it melts into an amber-colored liquid.
    - Once melted, add the butter, and stir until fully combined.

2. **Complete the Sauce:**
    - Remove from heat and slowly add the heavy cream while stirring continuously until smooth.
    - Stir in the sea salt.
    - Allow the sauce to cool slightly.

### Serve:
- Serve individual slices of the warm Tarte Tatin with a spoonful of crème fraîche and a generous drizzle of caramel sauce.

### Wine Pairing:
- Pair this dish with a sweet and vibrant Veuve Clicquot Demi-Sec to complement the flavors and enhance your dessert experience.

### Tips:
- Use firm apples to maintain the structure of the tart.
- Be cautious when working with caramel, as it can burn quickly.
