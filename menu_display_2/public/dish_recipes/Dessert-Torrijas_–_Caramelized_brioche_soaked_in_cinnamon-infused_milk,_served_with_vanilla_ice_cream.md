**Instructions:**

#### Preparing the Milk Mixture
1. In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine the whole milk, heavy cream, 1/2 cup sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract.
2. Stir occasionally and heat the mixture just until it is warm and the sugar is dissolved. Do not let it boil.
3. Once warm, remove from heat and let it cool slightly.

#### Soaking the Brioche
4. Place the brioche slices in a shallow dish or baking pan in a single layer.
5. Pour the cooled milk mixture over the brioche, ensuring each slice is thoroughly coated.
6. Allow the brioche to soak for at least 15-20 minutes, turning them occasionally so they soak evenly on both sides.

#### Cooking the Torrijas
7. Crack the eggs in a wide, shallow bowl and beat them until well combined.
8. Heat the unsalted butter in a large nonstick pan over medium heat.
9. Carefully dip each soaked slice of brioche in the beaten eggs, ensuring they are fully coated on both sides.
10. Fry the brioche slices in the butter until they are golden brown and caramelized on both sides, approximately 2-3 minutes per side.
11. Remove the toasted brioche from the pan and keep warm.

#### Caramelizing the Sugar
12. In a small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of water over medium heat.
13. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then increase the heat and bring it to a simmer.
14. Continue simmering without stirring for about 6-8 minutes, or until the mixture turns a deep amber color.
15. Carefully remove from heat, as the caramel will be very hot, and let it cool slightly.

#### Plating and Serving
16. To serve, place each torrija on a dessert plate.
17. Drizzle the warm caramel over the torrijas.
18. Add a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.
19. Pair with a glass of Pedro Ximénez Bodegas Toro Albala Don PX Gran Reserva 1987 for a perfect accompaniment.

**Notes:**
- Ensure the caramel sauce is not too hot when drizzling over the brioche to prevent it from becoming too sticky.
- For an additional texture, consider topping the dish with toasted nuts or a light dusting of powdered sugar before serving.

This classic Spanish dessert is rich and indulgent, perfectly pairing the creamy vanilla notes of the ice cream with the sweet, caramelized essence of the brioche.
