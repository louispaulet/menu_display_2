## Creamy Wild Mushroom Bisque with Black Truffle Foam and Brioche Croutons

### Ingredients

#### For the Mushroom Bisque:
- 500g assorted wild mushrooms (chanterelles, morels, porcini)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium shallot, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- 750ml vegetable stock
- 125ml heavy cream
- 1 sprig fresh thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

#### For the Black Truffle Foam:
- 100ml milk (whole milk preferred)
- 1 tsp black truffle oil
- A pinch of salt

#### For the Brioche Croutons:
- 4 slices of brioche bread, cut into cubes
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- A pinch of salt

### Instructions

#### Preparing the Mushroom Bisque:
1. Clean and roughly chop the mushrooms. In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and sauté until they release moisture and start to brown, about 5-7 minutes.
2. Add the shallots and garlic to the pot, and cook until the shallots become translucent.
3. Stir in the butter, allowing it to melt, and then add the vegetable stock. Stir well to combine.
4. Add the thyme and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes.
5. Remove the thyme sprig and bay leaf. Use an immersion blender to purée the soup until smooth. Stir in the heavy cream and season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm.

#### Preparing the Black Truffle Foam:
1. In a small saucepan, warm the milk over low heat until steam begins to rise. Do not let it boil.
2. Remove from heat and stir in the black truffle oil and salt.
3. Use a milk frother to foam the milk to a light, airy texture. Set aside.

#### Making the Brioche Croutons:
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. In a skillet, melt the butter over medium heat and add the crushed garlic. Allow the garlic to infuse the butter for about 2 minutes, then remove from heat.
3. Toss the brioche cubes in the garlic-infused butter until evenly coated.
4. Spread the cubes on a baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes or until golden and crispy. Turn halfway for even browning.

### Plating
1. Ladle the mushroom bisque into individual serving bowls.
2. Spoon a generous mound of black truffle foam on top of the bisque.
3. Garnish with brioche croutons and an optional drizzle of truffle oil for extra aroma.
4. Serve immediately, paired with a glass of Pinot Noir Kosta Browne Russian River Valley 2018 for a perfect culinary harmony.
