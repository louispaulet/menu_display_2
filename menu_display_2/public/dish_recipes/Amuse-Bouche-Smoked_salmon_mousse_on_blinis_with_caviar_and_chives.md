## Instructions

### Preparing the Blinis
1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, buckwheat flour, baking powder, and salt.
2. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, mix milk, yogurt, and egg until fully blended.
3. **Combine Mixtures:** Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until smooth. Then, stir in the melted butter.
4. **Cook Blinis:** Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and lightly coat with butter. Spoon in small amounts of batter to form blinis, approximately 2 inches in diameter. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden. Keep warm.

### Preparing the Smoked Salmon Mousse
1. **Blend Ingredients:** In a food processor, combine the smoked salmon, cream cheese, lemon juice, lemon zest, crème fraîche, and dill. Process until smooth and well combined.
2. **Season:** Taste and season with salt and pepper as desired.
3. **Transfer to Piping Bag:** Place the mousse in a piping bag fitted with a round or star tip for easy dispensing onto the blinis.

### Assembling Amuse-Bouche
1. **Pipe Mousse:** Pipe a generous dollop of smoked salmon mousse onto each warm blini.
2. **Add Caviar:** Gently place a small spoonful of caviar on top of the mousse.
3. **Garnish:** Sprinkle with freshly chopped chives for a splash of color and added flavor.
4. **Serve Immediately:** Arrange on a platter and serve promptly to enjoy the optimal blend of flavors and textures.
