## Ingredients
- 12 Medjool dates
- 4 oz (113g) fresh goat cheese, softened
- 1/2 cup pistachios, shelled and unsalted
- 1 tsp honey
- Zest of 1 lemon
- Pinch of sea salt


## Instructions

### Preparing the Dates
1. **Pit the Dates:** Using a paring knife, make a small incision along the length of each date. Carefully remove the pit while maintaining the shape of the date.

### Preparing the Filling
2. **Crush the Pistachios:** Place the pistachios in a sealable plastic bag. Using a rolling pin or the bottom of a saucepan, gently crush the pistachios into small pieces.
3. **Mix the Cheese Filling:** In a small mixing bowl, combine the softened goat cheese, honey, lemon zest, and a pinch of sea salt. Mix until the ingredients are well incorporated and smooth.

### Stuffing the Dates
4. **Fill the Dates:** Using a small spoon or a piping bag, fill each date cavity with about a teaspoon of the goat cheese mixture.
5. **Add Pistachios:** Gently press the open sides of each date to lightly secure the cheese, then dip the top cheese surface into the crushed pistachios, allowing the nuts to adhere.

### Plating
6. **Serve Immediately:** Arrange the dates artistically on a small platter. As this is an amuse-bouche, aim for a visually appealing presentation that invites guests to enjoy their first bite eagerly.
