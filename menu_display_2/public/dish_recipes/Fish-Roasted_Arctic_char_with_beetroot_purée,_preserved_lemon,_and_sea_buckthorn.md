## Ingredients

### For the Arctic Char
- 4 fillets of Arctic char, skin on
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### For the Beetroot Purée
- 500g beetroot, peeled and chopped
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 500ml vegetable stock
- 2 tablespoons crème fraîche
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### For the Preserved Lemon
- 1 preserved lemon, finely chopped

### For the Sea Buckthorn Sauce
- 100g sea buckthorn berries (fresh or frozen)
- 50ml water
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar

## Instructions

### Prepare the Beetroot Purée
1. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the chopped beetroot to the saucepan and cook for another 5 minutes.
3. Pour in the vegetable stock, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until the beetroot is tender, about 20-25 minutes.
4. Once cooked, use a blender or immersion blender to purée the mixture until smooth.
5. Stir in the crème fraîche and season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm.

### Prepare the Sea Buckthorn Sauce
1. Place the sea buckthorn berries and water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the berries are soft.
2. Pass the mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl, discarding the solids.
3. Stir in honey and white wine vinegar into the strained liquid to balance the tartness. Set aside.

### Cook the Arctic Char
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F).
2. Season Arctic char fillets with salt and pepper.
3. Heat the olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.
4. Add the char fillets skin-side down and cook until the skin is crispy, about 3-4 minutes.
5. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and roast for an additional 5 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through.

## To Serve
1. Spread a generous spoonful of beetroot purée onto each plate.
2. Place a roasted Arctic char fillet on top of the purée.
3. Spoon over the sea buckthorn sauce across the fish.
4. Sprinkle preserved lemon over the fillets.
5. Finish with a touch of freshly ground black pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

## Wine Pairing
Pair this dish with the refined notes of a **Pierre-Yves Colin-Morey Chassagne-Montrachet 2019**. Its delicate acidity and mineral undertones will complement the richness of the Arctic char and the bright flavors of lemon and sea buckthorn.
