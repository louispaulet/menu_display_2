# Creamy Tomato and Coconut Soup with Curry Leaf and Toasted Almonds

## Ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
- 10 fresh curry leaves
- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes
- 800g ripe tomatoes, chopped (or substitute with two 400g cans of whole peeled tomatoes)
- 400ml coconut milk
- 2 cups vegetable stock
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 tablespoon lime juice

## For Garnish:
- 1/4 cup toasted almonds, roughly chopped
- Fresh coriander, chopped

## Instructions:

### Preparing the Soup:
1. **Heat the Oil:** In a large saucepan over medium heat, warm the coconut oil.
2. **Sauté Aromatics:** Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, ginger, and curry leaves, cooking for an additional 2 minutes until fragrant.
3. **Toast the Spices:** Add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds, ground coriander, turmeric, and chili flakes. Toast the spices for about 1 minute, stirring constantly to avoid burning.
4. **Add Tomatoes:** Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes until they start to break down into a sauce.
5. **Incorporate Liquids:** Pour in the coconut milk and vegetable stock, bringing the mixture to a simmer.
6. **Simmer the Soup:** Season with salt and pepper to taste, and let the soup simmer gently for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
7. **Blend the Soup:** Remove the soup from heat and allow it to cool slightly. Then, using an immersion blender, blend the soup until smooth. Alternatively, carefully transfer batches to a standard blender and blend thoroughly.
8. **Finish the Soup:** Stir in the lime juice, adjusting seasoning with additional salt and pepper if necessary.

### Preparing the Garnish:
- **Toast Almonds:** Preheat a small frying pan over medium heat. Add the almonds and toast until golden brown and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes, stirring often to prevent burning.

### Serving:
1. **Plate the Soup:** Ladle the creamy tomato and coconut soup into warm bowls.
2. **Add Garnishes:** Top with toasted almonds and a sprinkle of fresh coriander.
3. **Devour:** Serve immediately, pairing it with a refreshing glass of Sauvignon Blanc, such as Cloudy Bay 2020, to complement the aromatic flavors.
