# Ikura Temaki with Shiso Leaf and Crispy Nori

Ikura temaki, also known as salmon roe hand roll, is a delicious Japanese delicacy that combines the rich, briny flavors of salmon roe with shiso leaves and crisp nori. This dish is simple to assemble and offers a delightful textural contrast and flavor balance.

## Ingredients:

- **1/2 cup** sushi rice
- **1 tbsp** rice vinegar
- **1 tsp** sugar
- **1/4 tsp** salt
- **4 sheets** of nori, cut in half
- **1/2 cup** ikura (salmon roe)
- **8 shiso leaves**
- **Soy sauce**, for serving
- **Pickled ginger**, for serving
- **Wasabi**, optional

## Instructions:

### Step 1: Prepare the Sushi Rice

1. **Rinse the Rice:** Rinse sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch. Drain well.
2. **Cook the Rice:** Using a rice cooker or stovetop, cook the sushi rice according to package instructions. Allow it to cool slightly.
3. **Season the Rice:** In a small saucepan, combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Warm over low heat, stirring until dissolved. Pour this mixture over the warm rice and mix gently with a cutting motion to avoid making the rice mushy. Set aside to cool to room temperature.

### Step 2: Assemble the Temaki

1. **Prepare Your Station:** Lay out the cut nori sheets, shiso leaves, and a bowl of ikura within reach for easy assembly.
2. **Place the Rice:** With a dry hand, take a nori sheet (shiny side down) and place a small amount of sushi rice (about 2 tablespoons) on the left side of the nori, leaving a margin at the edges.
3. **Add Toppings:** Place a shiso leaf on top of the rice, then arrange a small spoonful of ikura on top of the leaf.
4. **Fold the Temaki:** Fold the bottom left corner of the nori over the rice and fillings, and continue to roll it tightly into a cone shape.
5. **Seal the Seam:** Wet the exposed edge of the nori with a bit of water to seal the seam.

### Step 3: Serve

1. **Plate Presentation:** Arrange the temaki on a plate with the point side up.
2. **Garnish and Serve:** Serve immediately with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and optional wasabi for a complete experience.
3. **Wine Pairing:** Enjoy with a glass of Dewazakura Oka Ginjo, enhancing the subtle flavors of the dish.
