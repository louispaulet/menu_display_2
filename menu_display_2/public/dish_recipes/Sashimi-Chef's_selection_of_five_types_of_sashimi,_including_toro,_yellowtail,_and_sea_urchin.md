### Instructions

1. **Preparation of Sashimi:**
   - Ensure each fish type is thoroughly cleaned and checked for bones.
   - Using a very sharp knife, slice the fish into thin, even pieces. Aim for approximately 1/4 inch thickness for best texture.
     - **Toro:** Slice against the grain to highlight its marbled texture.
     - **Yellowtail:** Aim for semi-thick slices to enjoy its fatty richness.
     - **Sea Urchin:** Gently handle sea urchin roe, placing it in a spoon rather than slicing.
     - **Salmon:** Try to create delicate slices to capture its smoothness.
     - **Scallop:** Carve into thin slices across the width.

2. **Plating:**
   - Place crushed ice on a platter to keep the sashimi cool.
   - Arrange the sashimi in a visually appealing manner, grouping each type separately.
   - Garnish with julienned daikon, shiso leaves, fresh wasabi, and edible flowers.

3. **Serving:**
   - Serve immediately with sides of soy sauce and ponzu sauce.
   - Encourage guests to use each garnish to accentuate the flavor of different sashimi types.
