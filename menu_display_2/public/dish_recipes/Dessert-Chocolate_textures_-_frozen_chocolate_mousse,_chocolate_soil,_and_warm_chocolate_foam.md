#### Instructions

**Frozen Chocolate Mousse:**
1. Melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks with half of the sugar until pale and thickened.
3. In another bowl, beat the egg whites with the remaining sugar and salt until soft peaks form.
4. In a separate bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form.
5. Gently combine the melted chocolate with the egg yolk mixture.
6. Fold in the cream and then the egg whites until the mixture is smooth and well combined.
7. Pour the mousse into a container and freeze for at least 4 hours, or until firm.

**Chocolate Soil:**
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). 
2. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, cocoa powder, caster sugar, brown sugar, and salt.
3. Drizzle the melted butter over the dry ingredients and mix until clumps form.
4. Spread the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
5. Bake for 10-15 minutes, stirring halfway through, until it's crumbly but not burnt.
6. Let cool completely, then break into small crumbly pieces.

**Warm Chocolate Foam:**

2. Remove from heat and add chopped chocolate, stirring until smooth.
3. Add vanilla and a pinch of salt, stirring again.
