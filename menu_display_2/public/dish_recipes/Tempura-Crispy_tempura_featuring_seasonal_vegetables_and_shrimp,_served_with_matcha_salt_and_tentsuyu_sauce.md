### For Tentsuyu Sauce
- 200ml dashi stock

- 2 tablespoons mirin

## Method

### Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients
1. Pat the shrimp dry with a paper towel and lightly dust in plain flour. Set aside.
2. Prepare all the vegetables according to the slicing instructions above, ensuring they are dry before cooking.

### Step 2: Make the Batter
1. In a large bowl, lightly beat the egg yolk.
2. Add the ice-cold sparkling water to the yolk, mixing gently.
3. Sift in the all-purpose flour and cornflour, and stir until just combined (some lumps should remain; avoid overmixing).
4. Keep the batter cold at all times by resting it over a bowl of ice.

### Step 3: Prepare the Tentsuyu Sauce
1. In a small saucepan, combine the dashi stock, soy sauce, and mirin.
2. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat and then set aside.

### Step 4: Prepare the Matcha Salt
1. Combine the matcha powder and sea salt in a small bowl.
2. Mix thoroughly until well blended.

### Step 5: Fry the Tempura
1. Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or heavy-bottomed pot to 180°C (356°F).
2. Working in batches, dip the vegetables and shrimp into the batter, allowing excess to drip off.
3. Carefully drop them into the hot oil and fry until golden and crisp, about 3-4 minutes.
4. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel.

### Step 6: Serve
1. Arrange the tempura on a platter.
2. Serve immediately with the tentsuyu sauce in small bowls and a side of matcha salt for dipping.
