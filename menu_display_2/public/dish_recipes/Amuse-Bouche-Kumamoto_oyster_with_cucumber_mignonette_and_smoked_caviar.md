# Kumamoto Oyster with Cucumber Mignonette and Smoked Caviar

## Ingredients

### For the Cucumber Mignonette:
- 1/4 cup finely diced cucumber (peeled and seeded)
- 1 tablespoon finely diced shallots
- 1/4 cup champagne vinegar
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
- Pinch of salt

### For the Oysters:
- 1 dozen Kumamoto oysters, shucked
- Crushed ice, for serving

### For Garnish:
- 2 tablespoons smoked caviar
- Fresh dill sprigs (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Cucumber Mignonette:**
    1.1. In a small mixing bowl, combine finely diced cucumber and shallots.
    1.2. Stir in champagne vinegar, lemon juice, and sugar until the sugar dissolves.
    1.3. Add cracked black pepper and salt, and mix well.
    1.4. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the mignonette sit in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

2. **Shuck the Oysters:**
    2.1. Carefully shuck the Kumamoto oysters, ensuring you do not spill any of their natural juices. Detach the bottom muscle as needed so the oyster can slide out easily.
    2.2. Place the shucked oysters on a bed of crushed ice on a platter.

3. **Assemble the Dish:**
    3.1. Spoon a small amount of the chilled cucumber mignonette over each oyster.
    3.2. Place a small dollop of smoked caviar on top of the mignonette.
    3.3. Garnish with fresh dill sprigs, if desired.

4. **Serve and Pair:**
    4.1. Serve immediately while cold.
    4.2. Pair the oyster amuse-bouche with a glass of chilled Dom PÃ©rignon Vintage 2010, allowing the bright acidity and fine effervescence to complement the briny, fresh flavors of the dish.

## Chef's Note
- Feel free to adjust the seasoning in the mignonette according to personal preference. A touch more lemon or a pinch more pepper can really brighten the dish.
- Serve this amuse-bouche as an elegant start to a special meal, offering a luxurious play of textures and flavors with each bite.
