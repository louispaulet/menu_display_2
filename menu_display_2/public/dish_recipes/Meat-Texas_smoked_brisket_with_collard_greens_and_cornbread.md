- 1/4 cup kosher salt
- 1/4 cup coarse black pepper

#### For the Collard Greens
- 2 large bunches collard greens, leaves stripped from stems and washed
- 8 oz smoked ham hocks or bacon
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

#### For the Cornbread
- 1 cup yellow cornmeal
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup fresh corn kernels (optional)

### Method

#### Brisket
1. **Season the Brisket**: Mix the kosher salt and black pepper thoroughly. Coat the brisket generously on all sides with the mixture. Let the brisket sit at room temperature for an hour.
2. **Prepare the Smoker**: Preheat your smoker to 225°F using oak wood (or your choice of marked flavors).
3. **Smoking**: Place the brisket in the smoker, fat side up. Smoke until the internal temperature reaches 195°F to 203°F, approximately 1.5 hours per pound. This can take around 12 to 16 hours.
4. **Rest**: Remove from the smoker and allow it to rest, wrapped in butcher paper or foil, for at least an hour before slicing.

#### Collard Greens
1. **Preparation**: Trim the greens and remove any tough ribs. Cut into 2-inch pieces.
2. **Cook**: In a large pot, sauté the onion and garlic until soft. Add the ham hocks or bacon and cook until browned.
3. **Simmer**: Add the chicken stock, vinegar, red pepper flakes, and collard greens. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer covered for about 1 to 2 hours until greens are tender.
4. **Season**: Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.

#### Cornbread
1. **Preheat Oven**: Set oven to 400°F. Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.
2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. **Mix Wet Ingredients**: In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, and melted butter.
4. **Combine and Bake**: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Fold in the corn kernels if using.
5. **Bake**: Pour batter into pan, spreading evenly. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown.
6. **Cool and Serve**: Allow to cool briefly in the pan before slicing and serving.

### Wine Pairing

Serve the dish with a **Cabernet Sauvignon Silver Oak Alexander Valley 2016**, whose bold flavors and tannins complement the smokiness of the brisket beautifully. The wine's rich fruit profile also pairs excellently with the savory elements in the collard greens and cornbread.
