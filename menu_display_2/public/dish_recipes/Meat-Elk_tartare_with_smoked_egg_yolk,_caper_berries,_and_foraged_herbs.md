### Ingredients:

#### Elk Tartare
- 300g of elk tenderloin
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil
- 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon of finely chopped shallots
- 1 tablespoon of caper berries, chopped
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- A few drops of Worcestershire sauce

#### Smoked Egg Yolk
- 4 large egg yolks
- 100g rice
- 50g tea leaves of your choice (assam or Lapsang souchong work well)
- 50g brown sugar

#### Foraged Herbs
- A mix of wild herbs such as sorrel, wood sorrel, chickweed, and dandelion leaves

#### Garnish
- Crusty sourdough bread, toasted and cut into slices
- Extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling
- Lemon wedges

### Instructions:

#### Preparing the Smoked Egg Yolks
1. In a small bowl, carefully separate the egg yolks from the whites. Reserve the whites for another use.
2. In a large heavy-based pan, line the bottom with aluminum foil.
3. Mix the rice, tea leaves, and brown sugar together and spread evenly over the lined foil.
4. Place a wire rack on top of the pan, ensuring it is above the smoking mixture.
5. Heat the pan over medium-high heat until the sugar mixture begins to smoke.
6. Gently place the egg yolks on a small plate, then set the plate on the wire rack. Cover with a lid or foil.
7. Smoke the yolks for about 10-12 minutes until they take on a smoky aroma. Remove and allow to cool.

#### Preparing the Elk Tartare
1. Blitz the elk tenderloin in a food processor briefly until finely chopped, or use a sharp knife to finely dice manually.
2. In a bowl, combine the chopped elk with olive oil, mustard, shallots, and chopped caper berries.
3. Season with salt, pepper, and a few drops of Worcestershire sauce. Adjust seasoning as required.

#### Plating the Dish
1. Divide the elk tartare among four plates, forming a small mound in the middle of each plate.
2. Make a small indent at the center of the tartare and gently place a smoked egg yolk in the indent.
3. Arrange the foraged herbs attractively around the tartare using tweezers if needed.
4. Drizzle a bit of extra virgin olive oil over the herbs and the tartare.
5. Serve with toasted sourdough slices on the side along with lemon wedges for a fresh squeeze of juice if desired.
