## Instructions

### Birch Sap Sorbet
1. **Combine Ingredients:** In a saucepan, mix birch sap, sugar, and lemon zest. Gently heat until the sugar dissolves completely.
2. **Infuse:** Remove the saucepan from heat and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature.
3. **Add Lemon Juice:** Stir in the fresh lemon juice.
4. **Freeze:** Pour the mixture into an ice-cream machine and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions, or pour into a shallow dish and freeze, stirring every 30 minutes until it reaches a sorbet consistency.
5. **Store:** Once churned, store in an airtight container in the freezer until ready to serve.

### Wild Blueberries Compote
1. **Combine Ingredients:** In a saucepan, combine wild blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, and zest.
2. **Cook:** Over low heat, cook the mixture until the blueberries burst and the mixture thickens slightly, about 15 minutes.
3. **Cool:** Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator.

### Spruce Needle Meringue
1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 100°C (212°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. **Beat Egg Whites:** In a clean, dry bowl, whisk egg whites with cream of tartar until soft peaks form.
3. **Add Sugar:** Gradually add the sugar, a spoonful at a time, beating continuously until the meringue is thick and glossy.
4. **Add Spruce Needles:** Gently fold in the finely chopped spruce needles.
5. **Shape and Bake:** Pipe or spoon small dollops of the meringue mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 1-1.5 hours or until meringues are dry and easily peel off the parchment.
6. **Cool:** Turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside to cool completely before removing.

## Plating
1. On each dessert plate, place a scoop of birch sap sorbet in the center.
2. Drizzle or spoon blueberry compote around the sorbet.
3. Garnish with spruce needle meringues, adding a touch of green with extra spruce needles if desired.

Pair with a chilled glass of Domaine Huet Vouvray Moelleux Le Mont 2019 to complement the dish's earthy and sweet undertones. Enjoy your refreshing and forest-inspired dessert!
