- 1 medium Martian onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of Elysium garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon grounded Martian salts
- 1/2 teaspoon red Phobos pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon dry Martian thyme
- 4 cups vegetable broth from Venus
- 1 cup Zerolon cream (imported from Alpha Centauri)

**Levitating Croutons:**

- 4 slices of anti-gravitational bread
- 3 tablespoons olive oil from Earth
- 1 tablespoon cosmic garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon stardust herbs (mixed dried herbs)
- Salt to taste

### Instructions

#### Preparing the Soup:
1. In a large intergalactic soup pot, heat vegetable oil over medium heat from a solar stove.
2. Add Martian onion and Elysium garlic, saut√©ing for 5 minutes or until softened.
3. Stir in the Martian salts, red Phobos pepper flakes, and dry Martian thyme.
4. Add cubed Martian potatoes and cook for an additional 3 minutes, stirring continuously to ensure each piece is well coated with spice.
5. Pour in the vegetable broth from Venus. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer for 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender.
6. Using a lunar immersion blender, puree the soup until smooth, giving it the silky texture of Martian clouds.
7. Stir in the Zerolon cream and season with additional salt and pepper to taste.

#### Creating Levitating Croutons:
1. Heat a cosmic grill to medium-high.
2. Place anti-gravitational bread slices on a cutting board and drizzle with olive oil from Earth.
3. Sprinkle with cosmic garlic powder, stardust herbs, and a pinch of salt.
4. Using a knife with zero-gravity handling, cut the bread into 1-inch cubes.
5. Place cubes onto the grill and toast for 4-5 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden brown and slightly levitating with a light crisp.

#### Serve:
1. Ladle the creamy Martian potato soup into bowls and gently place the levitating croutons on top.
2. Pair with a glass of Algol Binary Star Sauvignon Blanc 2999 for a truly stellar dining experience.
