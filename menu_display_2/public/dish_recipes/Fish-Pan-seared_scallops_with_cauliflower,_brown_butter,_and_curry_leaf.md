### Scallops
- 12 fresh large sea scallops
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons clarified butter or light olive oil

### Cauliflower Puree
- 1 medium cauliflower, broken into florets
- 500 ml (about 2 cups) milk
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Salt, to taste

### Brown Butter Sauce
- 100 g (7 tablespoons) unsalted butter
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 12 fresh curry leaves

### Garnish
- Microgreens

## Instructions

### Preparing the Cauliflower Puree
1. **Cook the Cauliflower**: In a medium saucepan, combine the cauliflower florets and milk. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, until the cauliflower is tender.

2. **Blend the Puree**: Remove the cauliflower from the milk with a slotted spoon and transfer it to a blender, adding in the butter and a pinch of salt. Blend until smooth and velvety. Adjust seasoning to taste. Keep warm until serving.

### Prepare the Brown Butter
3. **Cook the Butter**: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat until it starts to foam. Continue cooking, gently swirling the pan, until it turns a nutty brown color.

4. **Finish the Sauce**: Remove from heat, add the lemon juice, salt, pepper, and curry leaves. Allow the leaves to infuse in the butter for a few minutes. Strain and keep warm.

### Cook the Scallops
5. **Prep the Scallops**: Pat the scallops dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.

6. **Sear the Scallops**: Heat clarified butter or oil in a heavy skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add the scallops, and sear for 1-2 minutes on each side, until they develop a golden crust and are opaque in the center. Do not overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if necessary.

### Bring It All Together
7. **Plate the Dish**: Spoon a generous portion of cauliflower puree onto each plate, and top with three scallops. Drizzle the brown butter sauce around the plate and over the scallops.

8. **Garnish**: Add a few fresh microgreens for garnish.

### Serve
9. Pair the dish with a chilled glass of Chablis Domaine William FÃ¨vre Grand Cru Les Clos 2018 for a sophisticated dining experience.
