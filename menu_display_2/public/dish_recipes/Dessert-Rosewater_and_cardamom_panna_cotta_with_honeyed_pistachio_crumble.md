## Rosewater and Cardamom Panna Cotta with Honeyed Pistachio Crumble

### Ingredients:

#### Panna Cotta
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon rosewater
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 2 1/2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin
- 3 tablespoons cold water

#### Honeyed Pistachio Crumble
- 1/2 cup shelled pistachios, roughly chopped
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces
- 2 tablespoons light brown sugar
- Pinch of salt

### Instructions:

#### Panna Cotta
1. **Bloom Gelatin**: In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over 3 tablespoons of cold water. Allow to sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes spongy.

2. **Simmer Mixture**: In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the heavy cream, milk, and sugar. Stir occasionally until the sugar has completely dissolved and the mixture is hot but not boiling (do not let it boil).

3. **Mix Flavors**: Remove the saucepan from the heat. Stir in the vanilla extract, rosewater, and ground cardamom. Mix well to incorporate.

4. **Dissolve Gelatin**: Add the bloomed gelatin into the hot cream mixture, stirring until completely dissolved.

5. **Mold and Chill**: Pour the mixture into individual serving glasses or ramekins. Allow to cool slightly before refrigerating. Chill for at least 4 hours or until set.

#### Honeyed Pistachio Crumble
1. **Prepare Oven**: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Combine Ingredients**: In a mixing bowl, combine chopped pistachios, honey, flour, butter, brown sugar, and a pinch of salt. Use your fingers to rub the mixture together until it forms a crumbly texture.

3. **Bake Crumble**: Spread the crumb mixture evenly on a baking sheet. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown, stirring halfway through to ensure even baking.

4. **Cool and Store**: Remove from oven and let cool completely. The crumble will crisp up as it cools. Store in an airtight container until ready to use.

### To Serve
- **Plating**: When ready to serve, remove the panna cotta from the fridge. If you wish to unmold, briefly dip the ramekins in warm water and turn out onto a plate.

- **Finish with Crumble**: Top each panna cotta with a generous sprinkle of the honeyed pistachio crumble.

- **Optional Garnish**: For added elegance, consider garnishing with edible rose petals or a few whole pistachios.

### Wine Pairing
Serve with a light, effervescent glass of Moscato d'Asti Vietti Cascinetta 2021 to complement the floral and nutty notes of the dessert.
