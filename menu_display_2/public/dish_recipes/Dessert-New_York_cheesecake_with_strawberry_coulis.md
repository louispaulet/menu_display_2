## Ingredients

### Cheesecake Base
- 1 ½ cups of graham cracker crumbs
- ⅓ cup of unsalted butter, melted
- ¼ cup of granulated sugar

### Cheesecake Filling
- 4 (8 oz) packages of cream cheese, softened
- 1 ½ cups of granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract
- 4 large eggs
- 2/3 cup of sour cream
- 2/3 cup of heavy cream

### Strawberry Coulis
- 2 cups of fresh strawberries, hulled and halved
- ½ cup of granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon of lemon juice

## Instructions

### Cheesecake Base
1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).
2. In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar until evenly mixed.
3. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Use the back of a spoon to make sure the base is compact and even.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool while preparing the filling.

### Cheesecake Filling
1. In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.
2. Gradually add the sugar and vanilla, mixing until blended.
3. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
4. Mix in the sour cream and heavy cream until just combined.
5. Pour the filling over the cooled crust and smooth the top with a spatula.
6. Bake for 60-70 minutes, or until the center is set but still slightly jiggly.
7. Turn off the oven and crack the oven door open. Let the cheesecake cool slowly in the oven for about 1 hour.
8. Remove the cheesecake from the oven, run a knife around the edge of the pan, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

### Strawberry Coulis
1. Combine the strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
2. Cook until the strawberries release their juices and soften, about 10 minutes.
3. Remove from heat. Allow to cool slightly, then blend until smooth using an immersion blender or in a regular blender.
4. Strain the coulis through a fine mesh sieve to remove seeds.
5. Chill until ready to serve.

## Serving
1. Carefully remove the cheesecake from the springform pan and place on a serving platter.
2. Slice into wedges and serve each piece with a generous drizzle of strawberry coulis.

### Wine Pairing
- Pair this delightful dessert with a glass of **Brachetto d'Acqui Marenco Pineto 2020**, a sparkling red wine that complements the creamy richness of the cheesecake and the sweet berry notes of the coulis.
