## Sweet Shrimp Nigiri with Citrus-Infused Soy Sauce

### Ingredients:

#### For the Nigiri:
- 4 pieces of Botan Ebi (sweet shrimp), raw and fresh
- 1 cup sushi rice, cooked and seasoned
- Wasabi paste

#### For the Citrus-Infused Soy Sauce:
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- Juice of 1 yuzu (or 1 tablespoon lemon/lime juice if yuzu is unavailable)
- Zest of half a yuzu (or lemon/lime)
- Â½ teaspoon mirin

### Preparation Steps:

#### Sushi Rice:
1. Begin by preparing your sushi rice. Use short-grain Japanese rice for authenticity. Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice using a rice cooker or on the stove.
2. Once cooked, sprinkle rice vinegar and sugar over it, and fold gently with a rice spatula while fanning the rice to cool it quickly. This will give the rice its characteristic shine and flavor.

#### Citrus-Infused Soy Sauce:
1. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, yuzu juice, yuzu zest, and mirin.
2. Mix well and let the sauce sit for at least 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

#### Nigiri:
1. Peel the botan ebi, removing the shell and tail. Carefully devein the shrimp to ensure they are clean.
2. Wet your hands with vinegared water (equal parts water and rice vinegar) to prevent the rice from sticking.
3. Take a small portion of the seasoned sushi rice (about a tablespoon) and shape it into a rectangular mound using your right hand while pressing gently with your fingers to form a compact shape.
4. Apply a small amount of wasabi paste on top of the rice.
5. Place a botan ebi shrimp on top of the rice, pressing gently to adhere. Ensure the shrimp's tail and body are parallel to the rice.
6. Repeat until all shrimps are used.

#### Serving:
1. Plate the nigiri nicely on a serving platter.
2. Drizzle a small amount of citrus-infused soy sauce over each piece of shrimp.
3. Serve immediately with pickled ginger and additional soy sauce on the side.

### Wine Pairing:
- **Kubota Senju Ginjo**: This delicate sake pairs beautifully with the sweet shrimp, accentuating the citrus notes of the infused soy sauce, making each bite a delightful harmony of flavors.
