## Ingredients

- **Shrimp:** 
  - 10 oz wild-caught Amazonian shrimp, peeled and deveined

- **Ceviche Base:**
  - 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
  - 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
  - 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  - 1/4 teaspoon sea salt

- **Vegetables and Fruits:**
  - 1/2 cup ripe mango, finely diced
  - 1/4 cup red onion, finely chopped
  - 1 small red bell pepper, finely diced
  - 1 small cucumber, deseeded and finely diced

- **Herbs and Spices:**
  - 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro, finely chopped
  - 1 small aji amarillo pepper, seeded and minced (or 1 teaspoon aji amarillo paste)
  - 1 clove garlic, minced

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Shrimp:**
   - Bring a small pot of water to a rolling boil. Add the shrimp and cook for about 1 minute, until they turn pink and opaque. Immediately transfer the shrimp to an ice bath to stop the cooking process.
   - Once cooled, drain the shrimp and cut them into bite-sized pieces.

2. **Marinate the Shrimp:**
   - In a medium bowl, combine the lime juice, lemon juice, olive oil, black pepper, and sea salt. Add the chopped shrimp to the mixture, ensuring it is fully submerged. Cover and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes to absorb the flavors.

3. **Assemble the Ceviche:**
   - Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, combine the mango, red onion, red bell pepper, cucumber, cilantro, aji amarillo, and garlic. Mix well to combine.
   - After the shrimp has marinated, fold this vegetable and fruit mixture into the bowl with the shrimp. Stir gently to ensure even distribution of all ingredients.

4. **Serve:**
   - Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Present the ceviche in small chilled bowls or on spoons for easy handling. Garnish with additional cilantro leaves if desired.

5. **Wine Pairing:**
   - Pour chilled Champagne Dom PÃ©rignon Vintage 2010 to accompany the dish. The bubbles and crisp acidity of the champagne will elevate the citrus and spice notes of the ceviche.

Enjoy this vivid marriage of flavors that captures the essence of Amazonian seafood delicacies, expertly paired with an exquisite vintage champagne.
