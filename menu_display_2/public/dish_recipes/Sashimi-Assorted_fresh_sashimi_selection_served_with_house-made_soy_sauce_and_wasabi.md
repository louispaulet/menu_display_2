   - **Tuna:** Cut into long rectangular slices.
   - **Salmon:** Slice with a slight angle.
   - **Yellowtail:** Slice diagonally for maximum width.

4. Provide lemon slices if desired for drizzling over sashimi.

#### Step 3: Final Garnishes & Serving

1. Add a small serving of freshly grated wasabi to the side of the plate or provide a dollop of store-bought wasabi paste.
2. Serve immediately alongside the house-made soy sauce dipping bowl.

### Wine Pairing:

- **Kubota Manju Junmai Daiginjo Sake**: Its smooth, floral notes and delicate sweetness will complement the freshness and slight marbling in the sashimi, bringing harmony to the dining experience.

### Tips:

- Always use the freshest fish available to ensure the highest quality.
- Keep the fish refrigerated until just before serving to maintain its freshness.
- A sharp knife is essential for clean cuts and presentation.
