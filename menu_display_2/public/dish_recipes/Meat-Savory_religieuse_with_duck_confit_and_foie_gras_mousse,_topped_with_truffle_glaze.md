### Instructions:

#### Choux Pastry:
1. Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium saucepan, bring the water, butter, and salt to a boil.
3. Remove from heat and add the flour all at once. Stir vigorously until the dough comes together and forms a smooth ball.
4. Return the pan to the stovetop over low heat, stirring constantly for about 2 minutes to dry out the dough.
5. Transfer the dough to a mixing bowl. Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next.
6. Use a piping bag to pipe small and medium circles of dough onto the baking sheet.
7. Bake in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes until the profiteroles are puffed and golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.

#### Duck Confit Filling:
1. In a medium pan, sauté the shallot with a bit of duck fat until soft.
2. Add the shredded duck, thyme, and continue to cook until heated through.
3. Season with salt and pepper.

#### Foie Gras Mousse:
1. Gently heat the foie gras in a small saucepan until softened.
2. Blend with heavy cream until smooth and fluffy.
3. Season with salt and white pepper.

#### Truffle Glaze:
1. In a small saucepan, combine balsamic reduction, truffle oil, and honey.
2. Heat gently until incorporated and slightly thickened.

### Assembly:
1. Slice the top third from each choux and fill each one with the duck confit mixture.
2. Pipe a layer of foie gras mousse onto the duck confit base.
3. Replace the choux tops and drizzle with the truffle glaze.
4. Garnish with edible gold flakes if desired.

### Serving:
