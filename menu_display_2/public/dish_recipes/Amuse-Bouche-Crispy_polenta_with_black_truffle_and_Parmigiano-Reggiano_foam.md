### Crispy Polenta with Black Truffle and Parmigiano-Reggiano Foam

#### Ingredients

**For the Crispy Polenta:**
- 1 cup polenta (coarse cornmeal)
- 4 cups chicken broth or water
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley, thyme)
- Vegetable oil for frying

**For the Parmigiano-Reggiano Foam:**
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- Salt to taste
- White pepper, a pinch

**For the Garnish:**
- Fresh black truffle, thinly shaved
- Microgreens for garnish

#### Instructions

**Crispy Polenta:**
1. In a medium saucepan, bring chicken broth to a boil. Gradually whisk in the polenta until smooth. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the polenta is thick and creamy, about 25–30 minutes.
2. Stir in butter, grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, herbs, salt, and pepper. Pour the mixture into a greased baking sheet, spreading it into an even layer. Let it cool and set in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
3. Once set, cut the polenta into small squares or circles using a cookie cutter.
4. In a frying pan, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Fry polenta squares until golden brown and crispy on both sides. Remove and drain on paper towels.

**Parmigiano-Reggiano Foam:**
1. In a saucepan, bring cream to a simmer. Add the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and whisk until smooth.
2. Season with salt and white pepper to taste.
3. Strain through a fine sieve and transfer to an iSi foam siphon. Charge it with one cream charger and shake well. Keep warm.

**Assembly:**
1. Place a piece of crispy polenta on each serving plate.
2. Dispense a small amount of Parmigiano-Reggiano foam on top of the polenta.
3. Top with a few shavings of black truffle.
4. Garnish with microgreens and serve immediately.
