- 30g sugar
- Zest of 1 lemon
- Zest of 1 lime
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
- 1 teaspoon crushed black peppercorns

**For the Dill Cream:**
- 100ml crème fraîche
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- Salt and white pepper, to taste

**For the Cucumber Salad:**
- 1 English cucumber, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- Pinch of salt

**For the Rye Crisps:**
- 4 slices of rye bread
- Olive oil for brushing

#### Method:

**Step 1: Cure the Arctic Char**
1. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, sugar, lemon and lime zest, chopped dill, and crushed peppercorns.
2. Place the Arctic char fillet skin-side down on a large piece of plastic wrap. Generously cover the flesh with the curing mixture, pressing it down to ensure even coverage.
3. Wrap the fillet tightly in the plastic wrap, place it on a tray, and refrigerate for 24-36 hours to cure.

**Step 2: Prepare the Dill Cream**
1. In a bowl, combine the crème fraîche, chopped dill, and lemon juice. Mix until smooth and season with salt and white pepper to taste.
2. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

**Step 3: Make the Cucumber Salad**
1. In a small bowl, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Stir until the sugar dissolves.
2. Toss the cucumber slices in the vinegar mixture and allow to marinate for at least 15 minutes.

**Step 4: Prepare the Rye Crisps**
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. Brush the slices of rye bread with olive oil on both sides.
3. Cut each slice into thin strips and place them on a baking sheet.
4. Bake for 8-10 minutes until crisp and golden brown. Allow to cool.

**Step 5: Assemble the Dish**
1. Remove the Arctic char from the refrigerator and unwrap it. Rinse the curing mixture off the fillet under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels.
2. Using a sharp knife, thinly slice the cured Arctic char at an angle, leaving the skin behind.
3. To serve, arrange slices of cured Arctic char on each plate. Add a spoonful of dill cream beside it, and arrange a few slices of marinated cucumber over the char.
4. Garnish with rye crisps and a sprinkle of fresh dill.

#### Wine Pairing:
- **Riesling Trimbach Cuvée Frédéric Emile 2014**: This wine pairs beautifully with the delicate flavors of the cured char, enhancing the freshness of the dish with its vibrant acidity.
