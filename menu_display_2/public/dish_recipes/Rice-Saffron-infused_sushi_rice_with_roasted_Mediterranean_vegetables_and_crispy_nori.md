**For the Crispy Nori:**

**Garnish:**

#### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Saffron-Infused Sushi Rice:**
   - Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain well.
   - In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed rice, saffron threads, and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed.
   - In a small bowl, mix the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved. Once the rice is cooked, gently stir in the vinegar mixture and let it cool to room temperature.

2. **Roast the Mediterranean Vegetables:**
   - Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
   - On a baking sheet, toss the bell peppers, zucchini, eggplant, and onion with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
   - Spread them out in a single layer and roast for 25-30 minutes, stirring halfway through, until the vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized.

3. **Prepare the Crispy Nori:**
   - Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).
   - Brush each nori sheet lightly with sesame oil and sprinkle with a touch of sea salt.
   - Place on a baking sheet and bake for 5-7 minutes until crisp. Break into bite-sized pieces once cooled.

4. **Assemble the Dish:**
   - On serving plates, arrange a mound of saffron sushi rice, topped with the roasted vegetables.
   - Scatter crispy nori pieces over the top and garnish with fresh basil leaves, toasted sesame seeds, and lemon zest.

#### Wine Pairing
- **Chardonnay Marimar Estate La Màsía 2018**: This wine's rich, creamy texture and balanced acidity complement the saffron and roasted notes, enhancing the sushi rice and vegetable flavors with subtle oak undertones.

Enjoy this elegant and vibrant rice dish that beautifully combines Mediterranean flavors with a sushi twist.
