- 2 tablespoons olive oil

**For the Marinade:**
- 500 ml Rioja red wine
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 sprig fresh rosemary
- 1 tablespoon black peppercorns
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 carrots, peeled and sliced tough
- 1 onion, roughly chopped
- 1 stalk celery, chopped

**For the Red Wine Reduction:**
- 500 ml Rioja red wine (same as used in the marinade)
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Salt, to taste

**For the Porcini Mushroom Powder:**
- 50g dried porcini mushrooms

#### Instructions:

**Day 1: Marinade the Pork Cheeks**
1. Season the pork cheeks with salt and pepper.
2. In a large container, combine the pork cheeks with red wine, bay leaves, rosemary, peppercorns, garlic, carrots, onion, and celery.
3. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours, turning occasionally to ensure even marination.

**Day 2: Braise the Pork Cheeks**
1. Preheat the oven to 140°C (284°F).
2. Remove the pork cheeks from the marinade, reserving the liquid and vegetables.
3. Pat dry the pork cheeks with paper towels.
4. In a heavy ovenproof pot, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Sear the pork cheeks on all sides until browned. Remove from pot and set aside.
5. Add the reserved vegetables from the marinade into the pot and sauté until softened.
6. Pour in the reserved marinade liquid, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
7. Return the pork cheeks to the pot, ensuring they are submerged in liquid. Add water if necessary.
8. Cover the pot with a lid, transfer to the preheated oven, and braise for 24 hours.

**Day 3: Finish the Dish**
1. Remove the braised pork cheeks from the pot and strain the braising liquid.
   
   #### Red Wine Reduction:
   1. Pour the Rioja wine into a saucepan and reduce over medium heat by half.
   2. Add honey, allowing the mixture to thicken slightly.
   3. Incorporate the unsalted butter and season with salt.

2. While the reduction is simmering, preheat oven to 100°C (212°F) and dry the porcini mushrooms until completely dehydrated. Grind to a fine powder.

3. Plate the pork cheeks, drizzling with red wine reduction and a sprinkle of porcini mushroom powder.
