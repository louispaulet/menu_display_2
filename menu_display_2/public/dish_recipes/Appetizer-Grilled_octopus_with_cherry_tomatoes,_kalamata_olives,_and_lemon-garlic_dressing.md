- 2 tablespoons olive oil

### For the Lemon-Garlic Dressing:

## Instructions

### Preparing the Octopus:
1. **Boil the Octopus:**
   - In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the bay leaf, onion, garlic cloves, and carrot. Place the octopus in the pot and simmer for 45-60 minutes or until the octopus is tender.
   - Remove from heat, drain, and let the octopus cool slightly. Once cool to the touch, cut into bite-sized pieces.

2. **Grill the Octopus:**
   - Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.
   - Toss the chopped octopus in olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper.
   - Grill the octopus for 2-3 minutes on each side until lightly charred and heated through.

### Making the Lemon-Garlic Dressing:
1. **Prepare Dressing:**
   - In a small bowl, whisk together the extra-virgin olive oil, minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and chopped parsley.
   - Adjust seasoning according to taste.

### Assembling the Dish:
1. **Prepare the Salad Base:**
   - In a mixing bowl, combine cherry tomatoes, Kalamata olives, and red onion slices.
   - Drizzle with a tablespoon of the lemon-garlic dressing and toss to coat evenly.

2. **Plate the Dish:**
   - Arrange a bed of arugula or salad greens on each plate.
   - Spoon the tomato-olive mixture over the greens.
   - Top with grill-warm pieces of octopus.

3. **Finish with Dressing:**
   - Drizzle additional lemon-garlic dressing over the entire dish.
   - Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.

### Serving Suggestion:
Pair with a chilled glass of Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc 2020 to enhance the citrus and herbal notes of the dish.

## Tips
- If using frozen octopus, defrost it fully in the refrigerator before boiling.
- Be careful not to over-grill the octopus, as it can become tough; aim for a quick char.
- The dressing can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. Shake well before use.
