#### Ingredients

**For the Rosemary Crackers:**
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup semolina flour
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup water

**For the Parmesan Mousse:**
- 1 cup Parmesan cheese, finely grated
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon gelatin powder
- 2 tablespoons cold water
- Salt to taste

**For the Balsamic Pearls:**
- 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
- 1/4 teaspoon agar-agar powder
- 1 cup vegetable or olive oil (chilled in the freezer for at least 30 minutes)

#### Instructions

**Making the Rosemary Crackers:**
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, chopped rosemary, salt, and black pepper.
3. Slowly add the olive oil and water, stirring until a dough forms.
4. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thickness. Use a cookie cutter to cut into desired shapes.
5. Place on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes until golden brown.
6. Let cool completely on a wire rack.

**Preparing the Parmesan Mousse:**
1. Dissolve the gelatin in cold water and let it bloom for 5 minutes.
2. In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream until just before boiling, then remove from heat.
3. Stir in the bloomed gelatin until dissolved, followed by the Parmesan cheese.
4. Continue stirring until the cheese is fully melted. Season with a pinch of salt.
5. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve to remove any lumps.
6. Pour into a whipping siphon, charge with two gas canisters, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.

**Creating the Balsamic Pearls:**
1. Mix the balsamic vinegar with agar-agar powder in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring continuously.
2. Once boiling, remove from heat, and using a dropper, drop the balsamic agar mix into the cold vegetable oil, forming small caviar-like pearls.
3. Strain the pearls from the oil and rinse under cold water. Store the pearls in water until ready to use.

#### Assembly
1. Place a dollop of Parmesan mousse on each rosemary cracker.
2. Carefully place a few balsamic pearls on top of the mousse.
3. Arrange finished pieces on a serving platter for a beautiful presentation.
