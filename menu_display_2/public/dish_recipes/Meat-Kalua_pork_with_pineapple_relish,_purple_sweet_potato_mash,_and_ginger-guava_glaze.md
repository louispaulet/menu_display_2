## Instructions

### Preparing the Kalua Pork:
1. **Marinate the Pork:** Rub the pork shoulder with Hawaiian sea salt and liquid smoke. If using banana leaves, wrap the pork with them to add subtle flavor.

2. **Slow Cook the Pork:** Place pork in a slow cooker or a dutch oven. Cook on low for 8-9 hours or until the meat is tender and can easily be shredded with a fork.

3. **Shred the Pork:** Once cooked, remove the pork, discard banana leaves, and shred the meat using two forks. Keep warm.

### Making the Pineapple Relish:
1. **Mix the Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, combine diced pineapple, red onion, red bell pepper, and cilantro.

2. **Season the Relish:** Add lime juice, salt, and pepper to taste, and mix well. Let the relish sit for at least 15 minutes to meld flavors.

### Preparing the Purple Sweet Potato Mash:
1. **Boil the Potatoes:** Place sweet potatoes in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Cook until tender, about 15-20 minutes.

2. **Mash the Potatoes:** Drain well and return to pot. Add butter and coconut milk, then mash until smooth. Season with salt to taste.

### Making the Ginger-Guava Glaze:
1. **Combine and Heat Ingredients:** In a small saucepan, combine guava juice, grated ginger, brown sugar, soy sauce, and rice vinegar. Bring to a low simmer over medium heat.

2. **Thicken the Glaze:** Stir in the cornstarch slurry and cook until the mixture slightly thickens, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat.

### Plating the Dish:
1. **Assemble the Plate:** Place a generous scoop of purple sweet potato mash on each plate. Top with a portion of shredded Kalua pork.

2. **Garnish with Relish and Glaze:** Spoon some pineapple relish over the pork and drizzle with ginger-guava glaze.

3. **Serve:** Serve immediately with a glass of Pinot Noir Domaine Serene Yamhill Cuvée 2018 for a complete dining experience.

Enjoy this tropical and aromatic dish that combines tender pork with bright, vibrant flavors and a delightful finish from the Pinot Noir!
