## Ingredients

### For the Tuna Tartare
- 200g sushi-grade tuna, finely diced
- 1 tbsp shallots, finely minced
- 1 tsp garlic, minced
- 1 tsp ginger, grated
- 1 red chili, finely chopped (adjust to taste)
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp lime juice
- 1 tsp kecap manis (sweet soy sauce)
- 1 tbsp coriander (cilantro), finely chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste

### For the Cassava Chips
- 200g cassava, peeled and thinly sliced
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- Salt to taste
- Oil for frying

### Garnish
- Edible flowers or microgreens
- Additional coriander leaves

## Instructions

### Preparing the Cassava Chips
1. **Prepare the Cassava:** Peel the cassava and use a mandoline slicer to slice it into thin rounds.
2. **Parboil the Cassava:** In a pot of boiling water, add the cassava slices and a teaspoon of turmeric powder. Parboil for about 2-3 minutes until they are slightly tender, then drain and pat dry with a paper towel.
3. **Fry the Cassava Chips:** In a deep frying pan, heat oil to 180°C (350°F). Fry the cassava slices in batches until they are golden and crispy. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Season immediately with salt while still hot.

### Preparing the Tuna Tartare
1. **Mix Ingredients:** In a mixing bowl, combine the diced tuna with minced shallots, garlic, ginger, chili, soy sauce, sesame oil, lime juice, kecap manis, and chopped coriander. Mix gently to incorporate all flavors.
2. **Season:** Taste and adjust with salt and pepper to your liking.

### Assembling the Amuse-Bouche
1. **Topping the Cassava Chips:** Place a small spoonful of the tuna tartare onto each crispy cassava chip just prior to serving to prevent the chips from becoming soggy.
2. **Garnishing:** Top with a few leaves of coriander, edible flowers, or microgreens for a burst of color and fresh flavor.

### Serving
- Arrange the tuna-topped cassava chips on a serving platter.
- Serve immediately as an amuse-bouche accompanied by a chilled glass of Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc 2020.
