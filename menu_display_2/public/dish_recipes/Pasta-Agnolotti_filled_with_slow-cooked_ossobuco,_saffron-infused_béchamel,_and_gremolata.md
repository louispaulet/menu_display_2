### Instructions:

#### Ossobuco Filling:
1. **Season the Veal:** Pat veal shanks dry with paper towels, season with salt and pepper, and dust with flour on all sides.
2. **Sear the Meat:** In a large Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Sear the veal shanks on all sides until browned. Remove from the pot and set aside.
3. **Cook the Vegetables:** In the same pot, add onions, carrots, celery, and garlic. Cook until softened, about 8 minutes.
4. **Deglaze the Pot:** Add white wine and scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
5. **Simmer the Sauce:** Stir in beef stock, diced tomatoes, bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, and lemon zest.
6. **Add the Veal Back:** Return the veal shanks to the pot, coating with the sauce.
7. **Slow Cook:** Cover the pot and transfer to a preheated oven at 325°F (160°C) for about 2-3 hours.
8. **Shred the Meat:** Once the meat is tender and falling off the bone, remove from the pot and let cool slightly before shredding. Use the juices to moisten the shredded meat as needed.

#### Saffron Béchamel:
1. **Infuse the Milk:** In a small saucepan, warm milk with saffron threads over low heat and let steep off the heat for 15 minutes.
2. **Make the Béchamel:** In a separate saucepan, melt butter, then whisk in flour to form a roux. Cook for 1-2 minutes.
3. **Combine:** Gradually add saffron milk, whisking continuously until thickened. Season with salt, white pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. 
4. **Cool:** Set aside to cool slightly.

#### Gremolata:
1. **Mix Ingredients:** In a small bowl, combine parsley, lemon zest, garlic, and salt. Set aside.

#### Pasta Dough:
1. **Form the Dough:** Mound the flour on a clean surface, make a well in the center, add the eggs and salt.
2. **Knead:** Gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs and knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
3. **Rest:** Wrap in plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes.
4. **Roll & Cut:** Roll out the dough to about 1mm thickness, cut into squares of about 8x8cm for agnolotti preparation.

#### Assemble the Agnolotti:
1. **Fill the Pasta:** Place a teaspoon of ossobuco filling on each pasta square. Fold into agnolotti, sealing the edges.
2. **Cook the Pasta:** Boil agnolotti in salted water for 3-4 minutes, or until al dente.
3. **Plating:** Arrange on a plate, drizzle with saffron béchamel, and sprinkle with gremolata.
