- 50g sugar
- 250ml heavy cream, chilled

### Baklava Crumble
- 100g phyllo pastry sheets, crumbled

- 1 teaspoon rosewater

## Instructions

### Prepare the Chocolate Mousse
1. **Melt the Chocolate**: In a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water, melt the dark chocolate until smooth. Once melted, stir in the mastiha liqueur. Set aside to cool slightly.

2. **Whip the Egg Whites**: In another bowl, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar and continue whipping until stiff peaks are achieved.

3. **Blend the Egg Yolks**: In a separate bowl, lightly beat the egg yolks and gently fold them into the melted chocolate mixture.

4. **Combine the Mixtures**: Fold one third of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it, then fold in the rest gently to maintain volume.

5. **Whip the Cream**: In another bowl, whip the chilled heavy cream to soft peaks and carefully fold it into the chocolate and egg mixture.

6. **Chill the Mousse**: Divide the mousse into serving glasses and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or until set.

### Prepare the Baklava Crumble
1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).

2. **Toss the Pastry**: In a bowl, combine crumbled phyllo pastry sheets with melted butter, walnuts, honey, rosewater, and cinnamon.

3. **Bake the Crumble**: Spread the mixture onto a baking tray and bake for 8-10 minutes, stirring halfway through, until golden and crisp. Let it cool completely.

### Assemble and Garnish the Dessert
1. **Top with Crumble**: Before serving, evenly distribute the baklava crumble over the set mousse.

2. **Garnish**: Add small pieces of edible gold leaf on top for an opulent finish, and scatter a few fresh rose petals, if desired.

3. **Serve**: Pair with a glass of 2017 Muscat of Samos Nectar for an exquisite dining experience.
