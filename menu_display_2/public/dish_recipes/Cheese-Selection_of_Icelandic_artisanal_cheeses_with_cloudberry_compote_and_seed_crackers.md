## Directions

### Cloudberry Compote
1. **Prepare the Cloudberries**: If using frozen cloudberries, thaw them at room temperature. Rinse fresh cloudberries carefully to remove any impurities.
2. **Cook the Compote**: In a medium saucepan, combine cloudberries, sugar, and water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
3. **Add Flavors**: Once simmering, add lemon zest and vanilla extract. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes, until the mixture thickens and cloudberries are soft, releasing their juices.
4. **Cool**: Remove from heat and let the compote cool to room temperature. Transfer to a jar and refrigerate until ready to use.

### Seed Crackers
1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 180째C (350째F) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
2. **Mix Ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine all seeds, oats, whole wheat flour, and salt.
3. **Bind the Mixture**: Add olive oil and water, stirring until the mixture forms a sticky dough.
4. **Form Crackers**: Spread the dough evenly on the prepared baking tray using a spatula or damp hands. Aim for a uniform thickness for even baking.
5. **Bake**: Place in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.
6. **Cool and Break**: Allow the cracker sheet to cool before breaking it into rustic pieces.

### Plating
1. **Assemble Cheese Platter**: Arrange the selection of Icelandic cheeses on a large platter, grouped or fanned artistically.
2. **Add Accents**: Place a small bowl of cloudberry compote on the side of the platter.
3. **Serve with Crackers**: Add broken seed cracker pieces artistically around the cheeses.
4. **Final Touch**: Garnish with fresh herbs like dill or rosemary if desired.

## Wine Pairing
- **Wine Recommendation**: Gew체rztraminer Zind-Humbrecht Alsace 2019. This aromatic wine, with its floral and spicy notes, harmonizes with the creaminess and tangy accents of the dish.

Enjoy this elegant and sophisticated course as a fantastic starter or concluding highlight to a luxurious meal.
