## Instructions

### Preparing the Fish:
1. In a small bowl, mix the minced garlic, shallots, tamarind paste, soy sauce, lime juice, salt, sugar, and vegetable oil to form a marinade.
2. Score the fish on both sides to allow the marinade to penetrate.
3. Rub the marinade generously over the fish, making sure to get into the scored areas. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.

### Grilling the Fish:
4. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.
5. Lightly oil the grill grates to prevent the fish from sticking.
6. Grill the fish, skin side down initially, for about 10 minutes per side or until the flesh easily flakes with a fork.

### Making Sambal Matah:
7. While the fish is grilling, prepare the Sambal Matah by combining all the ingredients in a bowl. Mix well to ensure an even distribution of flavors.
8. Taste the sambal and adjust seasoning with salt or lime as desired.

### Cooking the Steamed Rice:
9. Rinse the jasmine rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.
10. In a pot, combine the rinsed rice and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat.
11. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and let simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.
12. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.

### Serving:
13. Serve the grilled fish hot, topped with a generous spoonful of Sambal Matah.
14. Accompany with steamed jasmine rice.
15. Pour a glass of Pascal Jolivet Pouilly-Fumé 2020 to enhance the meal.
