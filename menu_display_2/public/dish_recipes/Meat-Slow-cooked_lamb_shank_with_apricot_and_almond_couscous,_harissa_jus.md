- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 carrots, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 1 cup red wine
- 2 bay leaves
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### For the Apricot and Almond Couscous:
- 1 1/2 cups couscous
- 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
- 1/2 cup dried apricots, chopped
- 1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### For the Harissa Jus:
- 1 1/2 cups lamb braising liquid (strained from the cooked lamb shanks)
- 1-2 tablespoons harissa paste (adjust to taste)
- 1 tablespoon honey
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions

### Preparing the Lamb Shanks:
1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C).
2. In a large ovenproof pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Season the lamb shanks with salt and pepper, then brown them on all sides. Remove and set aside.
3. In the same pot, add the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery. Sauté until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
4. Stir in the tomato paste, cumin, coriander, and cinnamon. Cook for another 2 minutes until the spices are aromatic.
5. Pour in the red wine and bring to a boil, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pot.
6. Return the lamb shanks to the pot. Add the chicken stock and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer, cover, and transfer to the preheated oven.
7. Cook for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until the lamb is tender and falling off the bone. Remove the lamb and set aside, keeping warm.
8. Strain the braising liquid, skimming off excess fat. Reserve 1 1/2 cups for the harissa jus.

### Making the Apricot and Almond Couscous:
1. In a medium pot, bring the stock to a boil. Add the chopped apricots, and then the couscous.
2. Stir, cover, and remove from heat. Let it sit for 5 minutes to allow the couscous to absorb the stock.
3. Fluff the couscous with a fork. Stir in the toasted almonds, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.

### Preparing the Harissa Jus:
1. In a small saucepan, combine the reserved lamb braising liquid, harissa paste, and honey.
2. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the sauce slightly thickens. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

### Plating:
1. Spoon the apricot and almond couscous onto a warm plate, making a well in the center.
2. Sit one lamb shank in each couscous well.
3. Drizzle the harissa jus over the lamb shanks and garnish with fresh herbs if desired.
4. Serve immediately with a glass of Syrah E. Guigal Côtes du Rhône 2017.

Enjoy this autumnal, comforting dish, perfect for savoring the flavors of slow-cooked perfection.
