## Jamon Iberico with Pan Con Tomate

### Description
A delightful amuse-bouche that combines the rich, nutty flavor of Jamon Iberico with the refreshing and rustic taste of traditional Spanish pan con tomate. Perfectly paired with a glass of Cava Gramona Imperial Gran Reserva Brut 2016 to complement the savory and slightly sweet notes.

### Ingredients

#### For the Pan Con Tomate
- 4 slices of crusty bread (such as ciabatta or baguette)
- 2 ripe tomatoes
- 1 clove of garlic, peeled and halved
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Sea salt to taste

#### For the Jamon Iberico Topping
- 100 grams (3.5 oz) of Jamon Iberico, thinly sliced

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Tomatoes**
   - Grate the tomatoes using the large holes of a box grater, discarding the skins.
   - Place the grated tomato pulp in a small bowl and season with a pinch of sea salt.
   - Let it sit for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

2. **Toast the Bread**
   - Preheat your grill or a grill pan over medium-high heat.
   - Lightly brush each slice of bread with extra virgin olive oil.
   - Place the bread slices on the grill and toast until crispy and golden brown on both sides (about 2-3 minutes per side).

3. **Assemble Pan Con Tomate**
   - Remove the toasted bread from the grill and while still warm, rub one side of each toast with the cut side of the halved garlic clove for a subtle garlic flavor.
   - Generously spoon the prepared tomato pulp over each piece of bread.
   - Drizzle a little more olive oil on top and sprinkle lightly with sea salt.

4. **Serve with Jamon Iberico**
   - Cut each slice of pan con tomate into smaller bite-size pieces.
   - Place a piece of Jamon Iberico on top of each piece of tomato toast.

5. **Plate and Pair**
   - Arrange the Jamon Iberico topped pan con tomate on a serving platter.
   - Serve immediately alongside a chilled glass of Cava Gramona Imperial Gran Reserva Brut 2016 to enjoy the harmonious blend of flavors.

### Tips
