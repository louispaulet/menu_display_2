## Recipe: Tiramisù Semifreddo with Coffee-soaked Ladyfingers and Cocoa Nib Tuile

### Ingredients:

#### Semifreddo
- **4 large egg yolks**
- **100g caster sugar**
- **250g mascarpone cheese**
- **300ml double cream, cold**
- **1 tsp vanilla extract**

#### Coffee Soak
- **250ml strong espresso coffee, cooled**
- **100ml coffee liqueur (such as Kahlúa)**
- **2 tbsp sugar**
- **12 savoiardi (ladyfinger) biscuits**

#### Cocoa Nib Tuile
- **50g unsalted butter, melted**
- **50g plain flour**
- **50g caster sugar**
- **1 large egg white**
- **30g cocoa nibs**

#### Topping
- **Unsweetened cocoa powder** for dusting
- **Dark chocolate shavings** for garnish

### Instructions:

#### Preparing the Semifreddo
1. **Whisk the egg yolks and sugar** in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water (bain-marie) until thick and pale, for about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
2. **Fold in the mascarpone cheese** until smooth.
3. In a separate bowl, **whip the double cream** with the vanilla extract until soft peaks form.
4. **Gently fold the whipped cream** into the mascarpone mixture until combined. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag and refrigerate.

#### Coffee Soak
1. **Mix the espresso, coffee liqueur, and sugar** in a shallow dish, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.
2. Dip each savoiardi biscuit briefly into the coffee mixture, allowing them to soak for just a second or two on each side. Let excess coffee drip off each biscuit.

#### Assembling the Semifreddo
1. **Layer the bottom of individual serving glasses** with coffee-soaked ladyfingers.
2. Pipe a layer of mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers.
3. **Repeat the process**, ending with a layer of cream. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 4 hours or overnight.

#### Making Cocoa Nib Tuile
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
2. **Combine melted butter, flour, sugar, and egg white** in a bowl, mixing until smooth.
3. Drop small spoonfuls onto the prepared tray, spreading slightly with the back of a spoon.
4. **Sprinkle with cocoa nibs** and bake for 6-8 minutes or until golden brown around edges. Cool completely on a wire rack.

#### Finishing Touches
1. **Remove the semifreddo from the freezer** 5-10 minutes before serving. Dust the top with cocoa powder and finish with dark chocolate shavings.
2. **Serve each portion** with a cocoa nib tuile on the side, and enjoy with a glass of **Vin Santo del Chianti Classico Felsina 2009**.

### Chef's Tips:
- Ensure the coffee for soaking is cooled to prevent ladyfingers from getting overly soggy.
- The cocoa nibs add a delightful crunch to the tuile, contrasting beautifully with the smooth semifreddo.
