### Smoked Eel with Pickled Cucumber, Horseradish Cream, and Dill Oil

#### Ingredients:

**For the Smoked Eel:**
- 200g smoked eel fillets, skin removed

**For the Pickled Cucumber:**
- 1 medium cucumber
- 100ml rice vinegar
- 50g sugar
- 50ml water
- 1 teaspoon salt

**For the Horseradish Cream:**
- 100g crème fraîche
- 2 tablespoons freshly grated horseradish
- Juice of half a lemon
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

**For the Dill Oil:**
- 50g fresh dill, stems removed and roughly chopped
- 100ml olive oil
- Pinch of salt

#### Instructions:

**1. Prepare the Pickled Cucumber:**
   - Peel the cucumber and slice thinly using a mandoline or knife.
   - In a small saucepan, combine rice vinegar, sugar, water, and salt. Heat gently until the sugar and salt have dissolved completely. Allow to cool slightly.
   - Place cucumber slices in a bowl and pour the pickling liquid over. Ensure the cucumber is submerged. Leave to pickle in the fridge for at least 1 hour.

**2. Make the Horseradish Cream:**
   - In a bowl, mix crème fraîche with grated horseradish and lemon juice. Whisk until smooth.
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate until required.

**3. Prepare the Dill Oil:**
   - Blanch the dill in boiling water for 20 seconds, then immediately plunge into an ice bath to cool.
   - Once cooled, pat dry with paper towels and blend with olive oil and a pinch of salt until smooth.
   - Strain through a fine sieve or cheesecloth to achieve a clear, vibrant oil.

**4. Assemble the Dish:**
   - Arrange slices of smoked eel on each serving plate.
   - Drain pickled cucumber and distribute evenly over the eel.
   - Add a quenelle of horseradish cream beside the eel.
   - Drizzle with dill oil around the plate for garnish.
   - Serve immediately, pairing with a chilled glass of Pascal Jolivet Sancerre 2020.

#### Chef's Tips:
- Ensure your ingredients are fresh, especially the dill for the oil and the horseradish for the cream, to fully enhance the flavors of the dish.
- This dish is best served cold, allowing the distinct smoky eel flavor to balance out with the creamy, tangy, and herbaceous notes of the accoutrements.
