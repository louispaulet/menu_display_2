## Quinoa and Andean Cheese Chowder with Roasted Corn and Huacatay

### Ingredients
- 1 cup quinoa, rinsed and drained
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup of diced Andean cheese or cotija cheese
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 large potato, peeled and diced
- 2 cobs of corn, kernels removed
- 1 tablespoon fresh huacatay (or 1 teaspoon dried), finely chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)
- Lime wedges for serving

### Instructions

1. **Roast the Corn:**
   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Spread the corn kernels on a baking sheet and drizzle with a bit of olive oil.
   - Roast for about 15-20 minutes, stirring halfway through, until the corn is golden brown and slightly charred. Remove from oven and set aside.

2. **Cook the Quinoa:**
   - In a medium saucepan, combine the quinoa with 2 cups of vegetable broth.
   - Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Set aside.

3. **Prepare the Chowder Base:**
   - In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, sauté until onion is translucent (about 5 minutes).
   - Stir in the potatoes and cook for another 5 minutes.
   - Pour in the remaining vegetable broth and bring to a boil.
   - Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.

4. **Assemble the Chowder:**
   - Add cooked quinoa to the pot, along with the roasted corn, red bell pepper, Andean cheese, and huacatay.
   - Stir in the heavy cream, and season with salt and pepper.
   - Simmer gently until the cheese is melted and chowder is heated through.

5. **Serve:**
   - Ladle the chowder into bowls.
   - Top with fresh cilantro if desired.
   - Serve with lime wedges on the side for squeezing.

### Wine Pairing
Pair the chowder with a **Tabernero Gran Tinto Petit Verdot 2018**, a robust wine that complements the rich flavors of the chowder.

This dish combines the nutty and earthy flavors of quinoa with the creamy, slightly tangy Andean cheese. The roasted corn adds a hint of sweetness, and the huacatay provides a unique herbal note, making this a comforting yet sophisticated soup for any occasion.
