## Instructions

### For the Velouté
1. **Prepare the Asparagus**: Trim the woody ends of the asparagus and cut into small pieces, reserving the tips for garnish.
2. **Sweat the Aromatics**: In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, cooking until soft and translucent.
3. **Add Asparagus and Stock**: Add the chopped asparagus to the pot, stirring well. Pour in the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer for 15–20 minutes, until asparagus is tender.
4. **Blend and Season**: Using an immersion blender, blend the mixture until smooth. Add the cream, then season with salt, white pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Blend again if necessary to achieve a velvety texture.
5. **Cook Asparagus Tips**: Blanch the reserved asparagus tips in boiling salted water for 2 minutes, then shock in ice water to maintain color.

### For the Almond Cream
1. **Prepare Almonds**: Soak almonds in water for 2 hours, then drain.
2. **Blend Almonds**: In a blender, combine soaked almonds, milk, and cream. Blend until smooth.
3. **Strain**: Pass the mixture through a fine sieve. Season lightly with salt and set aside.

### For the Crispy Shallots
1. **Prepare Shallots**: Toss the sliced shallots in seasoned flour, ensuring even coating.
2. **Fry**: Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan. Fry shallots until golden brown and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon, draining on paper towels.

### Assemble the Dish
1. **Warm the Soup**: Reheat the soup gently if necessary, ensuring not to boil.
2. **Presentation**: Pour the velouté into warm soup bowls, drizzling almond cream subtly over the top.
3. **Garnish**: Scatter the blanched asparagus tips and crispy shallots, finishing with fresh chervil or parsley leaves.
