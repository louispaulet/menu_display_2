## Ingredients

### For the Caramelized Skyr Mousse
- 200g Skyr (Icelandic yogurt)
- 50g sugar
- 30ml birch syrup
- 200ml heavy cream
- 2 sheets gelatin

### For the Blueberry Sorbet
- 300g fresh or frozen blueberries
- 100g sugar
- 100ml water
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

### Garnish
- Fresh blueberries
- Mint leaves
- Birch sugar glass (optional)

## Instructions

### Caramelized Skyr Mousse
1. **Prepare Gelatin:** Soak the gelatin sheets in cold water for about 5 minutes to soften.
2. **Caramelize Skyr:** Place the Skyr and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar caramelizes slightly and blends with the Skyr. Remove from heat.
3. **Incorporate Gelatin:** Squeeze out excess water from the gelatin sheets and stir them into the warm caramelized Skyr mixture until completely dissolved. Then, add the birch syrup and stir to combine.
4. **Whip Cream:** In a separate bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form, then gently fold it into the Skyr mixture.
5. **Chill Mousse:** Transfer the mousse mixture into individual serving molds or glasses and chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or until set.

### Blueberry Sorbet
1. **Make Blueberry Syrup:** In a medium saucepan, combine the blueberries, sugar, and water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves and the blueberries release their juice. 
2. **Blend and Strain:** Once simmered, transfer the mixture to a blender and puree until smooth. Strain the puree through a fine mesh sieve to remove seeds and skin.
3. **Finish Sorbet Base:** Stir in the lemon juice, then chill the mixture in the refrigerator until completely cold.
4. **Churn Sorbet:** Pour the chilled blueberry mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions until it reaches a sorbet consistency. Transfer to a container and freeze for at least 2 hours before serving.

## Plating
1. Remove the caramelized Skyr mousse from the molds and place on a chilled plate. Alternatively, if using glasses, serve directly as is.
2. Add a scoop of blueberry sorbet alongside the mousse.
3. Garnish with fresh blueberries and mint leaves. For added flair, incorporate birch sugar glass if desired.

## Wine Pairing
