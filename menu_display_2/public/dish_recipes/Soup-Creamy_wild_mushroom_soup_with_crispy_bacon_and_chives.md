## Creamy Wild Mushroom Soup with Crispy Bacon and Chives

A rich and flavorful soup perfect for autumn evenings, paired beautifully with a Joseph Drouhin Côte de Beaune 2018. The earthy notes from the wild mushrooms are complemented by the savory addition of crispy bacon, with a refreshing hint from fresh chives.

### Ingredients

- 1 pound mixed wild mushrooms (shiitake, cremini, oyster), cleaned and chopped
- 4 strips bacon, diced
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups chicken or vegetable stock
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
- Olive oil, for cooking
- Fresh chives, chopped, for garnish
- Optional: Truffle oil, for drizzling

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Bacon:**
   - In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on paper towels to drain. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat in the pot.

2. **Sauté the Vegetables:**
   - Add a splash of olive oil to the pot if needed, and increase the heat slightly. Add the onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
   - Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 more minute, until fragrant.
   - Add the mushrooms to the pot and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 7-10 minutes.

3. **Make the Soup Base:**
   - Stir in the butter and let it melt. Sprinkle the flour over the mushroom mixture and stir well to coat.
   - Gradually pour in the stock, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer.

4. **Blend and Season:**
   - Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until smooth, or alternatively, transfer in batches to a countertop blender.
   - Return the soup to low heat and stir in the cream. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.

5. **Serve:**
   - Ladle the soup into bowls. Sprinkle with crispy bacon and chopped chives.
   - If desired, drizzle with a touch of truffle oil for an enhanced flavor.

### Wine Pairing

- Serve with **Joseph Drouhin Côte de Beaune 2018**, a wine that beautifully complements the earthy flavors of the mushrooms, providing a balanced tasting experience.

### Tips

- For a more intense mushroom flavor, consider adding a few dried porcini mushrooms to the soup initially, and remove before blending.
- Make sure to adjust the seasoning after blending since the mushrooms can absorb quite a bit of salt.
