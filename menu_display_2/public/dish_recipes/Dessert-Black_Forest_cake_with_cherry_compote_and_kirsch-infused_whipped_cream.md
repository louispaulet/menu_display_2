## Ingredients

### Chocolate Sponge Cake
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup buttermilk

### Cherry Compote
- 2 cups fresh or frozen cherries, pitted
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons kirsch (cherry brandy)

### Kirsch-infused Whipped Cream
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons kirsch
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Additional
- Dark chocolate shavings for garnish
- Fresh cherries, for garnish

## Instructions

### Chocolate Sponge Cake
1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line two 8-inch round cake pans with parchment paper.
2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. **Cream Butter and Sugar:** In a separate bowl, cream the sugar and butter together until light and fluffy. Add in the eggs, one at a time, followed by the vanilla, mixing well between each addition.
4. **Combine Ingredients:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk, starting and ending with dry ingredients.
5. **Bake:** Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
6. **Cool:** Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

### Cherry Compote
1. **Cook Cherries:** In a saucepan, combine cherries, sugar, and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is syrupy and the cherries are soft, about 10 minutes.
2. **Add Kirsch:** Stir in the kirsch and simmer for an additional 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.

### Kirsch-infused Whipped Cream
1. **Whip Cream:** In a chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form.
2. **Flavor Cream:** Add powdered sugar, kirsch, and vanilla to the whipped cream and continue whipping until stiff peaks form.

### Assembly
1. **Layer:** Place one chocolate sponge on a serving platter. Spread a layer of cherry compote over it, followed by a layer of whipped cream. Repeat with the second sponge.
2. **Top and Garnish:** Top with remaining whipped cream, smoothing the surface. Garnish with chocolate shavings and fresh cherries.
3. **Chill:** Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving to allow the flavors to meld.
