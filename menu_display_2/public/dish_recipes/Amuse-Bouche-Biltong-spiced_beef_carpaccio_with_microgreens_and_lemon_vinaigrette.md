### Biltong-Spiced Beef Carpaccio with Microgreens and Lemon Vinaigrette

#### Ingredients

- **For the Beef Carpaccio:**  
  - 200g center-cut beef fillet
  - 2 tablespoons biltong spice (you can find pre-mixed or make your own using coriander seeds, allspice, black pepper, clove, salt, and a hint of sugar)
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil

- **For the Lemon Vinaigrette:**  
  - 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
  - 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
  - 100 ml extra virgin olive oil
  - Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

- **For the Assembly:**  
  - A handful of microgreens (arugula, radish sprouts, or your choice)
  - Lemon zest (from 1 lemon)
  - Good quality sea salt (like Maldon)
  - Cracked black pepper

#### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Beef Fillet:**  
   - Wrap the beef fillet tightly in plastic wrap and place in the freezer for about 1 hour, until firm but not frozen solid. This makes it easier to slice the meat thinly.

2. **Slice the Beef:**  
   - Remove the fillet from the freezer and slice into very thin slices using a sharp knife or a meat slicer.
   - Arrange the slices of beef on a large plate, slightly overlapping.

3. **Season the Beef:**  
   - Drizzle the beef slices with olive oil and sprinkle the biltong spice evenly over the top. Gently press the spices into the meat.

4. **Prepare the Vinaigrette:**  
   - In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice and Dijon mustard. Gradually add the extra virgin olive oil in a slow stream, whisking constantly until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

5. **Assemble the Dish:**  
   - Sprinkle microgreens over the seasoned beef slices to cover evenly.
   - Drizzle the lemon vinaigrette over the beef and greens.
   - Garnish with lemon zest, a sprinkle of sea salt, and a few cracks of black pepper.

6. **Serve Immediately:**  
   - Serve the carpaccio immediately as a refreshing amuse-bouche, paired beautifully with a chilled glass of Hamilton Russell Vineyards Chardonnay 2020.

#### Tips:
- For a richer flavor, allow the seasoned beef to sit for a few minutes before serving to let the spices penetrate.
- Experiment with different microgreens to add varied flavors and textures.
