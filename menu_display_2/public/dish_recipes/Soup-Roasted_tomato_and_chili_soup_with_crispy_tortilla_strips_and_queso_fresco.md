### Roasted Tomato and Chili Soup with Crispy Tortilla Strips and Queso Fresco

#### Ingredients

**For the Soup:**
- 6 large ripe tomatoes, halved
- 2 red bell peppers, seeded and quartered
- 4 cloves garlic, unpeeled
- 1 large onion, peeled and quartered
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 3 cups vegetable or chicken stock
- 2-3 chipotle chilies in adobo sauce, chopped (adjust to taste)
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon lime juice

**For the Crispy Tortilla Strips:**
- 4 corn tortillas, cut into thin strips
- Vegetable oil, for frying
- Salt, to taste

**For Garnish:**
- 1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- Lime wedges, for serving

#### Instructions

1. **Roast the Vegetables:**
   - Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
   - Place the tomatoes, red bell peppers, garlic, and onion on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
   - Roast in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, until the vegetables are soft and slightly charred.
   - Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins.

2. **Prepare the Soup:**
   - In a large pot over medium heat, add the roasted vegetables, smoked paprika, and cumin.
   - Pour in the stock, add the chipotle chilies, and stir in the tomato paste.
   - Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for about 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
   - Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until smooth. Alternatively, transfer to a blender and blend in batches (be cautious of hot liquid splashes).
   - Stir in the lime juice and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if needed.

3. **Make the Tortilla Strips:**
   - In a small skillet, pour enough vegetable oil to cover the bottom to a depth of about 1/2 inch.
   - Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers.
   - Fry the tortilla strips in batches until crispy and golden brown. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt immediately.

4. **Serve:**
   - Ladle the soup into bowls.
   - Top each bowl with crispy tortilla strips, crumbled queso fresco, and chopped cilantro.
   - Serve with lime wedges on the side.

### Wine Pairing
This vibrant and spicy soup pairs beautifully with a crisp and aromatic Sauvignon Blanc, such as the Casa Marin Cipreses Vineyard 2019, which complements the smokiness of the chipotles and the creaminess of the queso fresco.
