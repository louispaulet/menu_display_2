### Instructions

#### Venison Medallions
1. **Prepare the Meat:** Season venison medallions with salt and pepper on both sides.
2. **Sear the Medallions:** Heat olive oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add medallions and sear for 2-3 minutes on each side, until browned.
3. **Finish Cooking:** Reduce heat to medium, add butter, rosemary, and garlic. Baste medallions with melted butter for additional 3-4 minutes until cooked to desired doneness. Remove from pan and let rest.

#### Red Cabbage
1. **Cook the Cabbage:** In a large saucepan, combine the red cabbage, apple, and onion. Stir in red wine vinegar, red wine, orange juice, vegetable stock, and brown sugar.
2. **Simmer:** Cover and cook on low heat for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is tender. Season with salt and pepper.

#### Spätzle
1. **Make the Dough:** In a bowl, mix flour with salt, then make a well in the center and add eggs and milk. Stir to form a smooth, thick batter.
2. **Cook the Spätzle:** Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Using a spätzle maker or colander, press dough through into the boiling water.
3. **Fry in Butter:** Once spätzle floats to the top, remove and drain. In a pan, melt butter and toss spätzle until lightly golden.

#### Lingonberry Sauce
1. **Prepare the Sauce:** In a small saucepan, combine lingonberry jam, port wine, and balsamic vinegar.
2. **Bring to a Boil:** Simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes, adjusting thickness with a bit more wine or a splash of water as needed.
3. **Season:** Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

### To Serve
1. **Plate the Dish:** On each plate, arrange a venison medallion, a portion of red cabbage, a scoop of spätzle, and drizzle with lingonberry sauce.
2. **Wine Pairing:** Serve with a glass of August Kesseler Pinot Noir 'R' 2017 for a perfect match.
