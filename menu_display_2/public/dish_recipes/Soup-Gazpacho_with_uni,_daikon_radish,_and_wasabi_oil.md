### Gazpacho with Uni, Daikon Radish, and Wasabi Oil

#### Ingredients:
- **For the Gazpacho:**
  - 1 lb ripe tomatoes, cored and chopped
  - ½ English cucumber, peeled and chopped
  - 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
  - 1 small red onion, chopped
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
  - ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
  - Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
  - ½ cup tomato juice (optional, for thinning)

- **For the Garnish:**
  - 4 ounces fresh uni (sea urchin roe)
  - 1 small daikon radish, peeled and thinly sliced into matchsticks
  - 2 tablespoons wasabi oil (store-bought or homemade*)
  - Microgreens or edible flowers for garnish
  
*Homemade Wasabi Oil: Mix ¼ cup neutral oil with 1 teaspoon wasabi paste. Let sit for at least 30 minutes to infuse.

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Gazpacho:**
   - In a blender or food processor, combine tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, onion, and garlic.
   - Add sherry vinegar and olive oil. Blend until smooth.
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.
   - If the gazpacho is too thick, add a little tomato juice to reach desired consistency.
   - Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to let the flavors meld.

2. **Prepare the Garnish:**
   - Slice the daikon radish into matchsticks and set aside.
   - Chill the uni and prepare wasabi oil if making it homemade. 

3. **Assemble the Dish:**
   - Pour chilled gazpacho into serving bowls.
   - Gently arrange a portion of uni in the center of each bowl.
   - Add a small mound of daikon radish beside the uni.
   - Drizzle wasabi oil over the top.
   - Finish with microgreens or edible flowers for a touch of elegance.

4. **Serve:**
   - Recommend pairing with a glass of Sancerre Domaine Vacheron Belle Dame 2018 to enhance the flavors and elevate the dining experience. 

#### Notes:
- The freshness of the uni is crucial as it brings a creamy richness that balances the acidity of the gazpacho.
- Adjust the amount of wasabi oil based on spice preference.
- Consider using heirloom tomatoes during the peak of summer for a sweeter, more flavorful gazpacho.

Enjoy this refreshing gazpacho as an elegant entree or a fine starter to impress guests with an explosion of oceanic and zesty flavors. Bon appétit!
