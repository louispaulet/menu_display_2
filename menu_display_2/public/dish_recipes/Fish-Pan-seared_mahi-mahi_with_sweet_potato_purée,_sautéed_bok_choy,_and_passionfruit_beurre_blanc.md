## Instructions

### Sweet Potato Purée
1. **Cook Sweet Potatoes:** Place the sweet potato cubes in a large pot of salted boiling water. Cook until tender, about 15 minutes.
2. **Mash Sweet Potatoes:** Drain and return to the pot. Add butter and heavy cream. Mash until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm.

### Sautéed Bok Choy
1. **Heat Oil:** In a large pan, heat sesame oil over medium heat.
2. **Sauté Garlic:** Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. **Cook Bok Choy:** Add bok choy and soy sauce, sauté until leaves are tender and stalks are crisp-tender, about 3-4 minutes. Season with salt to taste.

### Passionfruit Beurre Blanc
1. **Reduce Liquids:** In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine passionfruit juice, white wine, and shallots. Bring to a simmer and reduce to about 1/4 cup.
2. **Incorporate Butter:** Lower the heat and whisk in butter, piece by piece, until the sauce is thickened and creamy. Add salt to taste. Keep warm.

### Mahi-Mahi
1. **Season and Sear:** Pat mahi-mahi fillets dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat.
2. **Cook Fish:** Place fillets skin-side down and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until cooked through and golden brown.

### Assembly
1. Distribute sweet potato purée evenly among four plates.
2. Top each plate with a mahi-mahi fillet.
3. Arrange sautéed bok choy artfully around the fish.
4. Drizzle with passionfruit beurre blanc just before serving.
