# Maryland Crab Cake with Remoulade Sauce

## Ingredients

### For the Crab Cakes:
- 1 pound fresh Maryland blue crab meat, picked over for shells
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
- 1/4 cup finely chopped scallions (white and green parts)
- 3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs, plus more for coating
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

### For the Remoulade Sauce:
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon chopped capers
- 1 tablespoon chopped pickles
- 1 small garlic clove, minced
- 1 teaspoon hot sauce
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

### To Make the Crab Cakes:
1. **Prepare the Crab Mixture:** In a large bowl, gently combine the crab meat, mayonnaise, egg, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, Old Bay seasoning, and black pepper. Stir in the parsley, scallions, and panko breadcrumbs until just combined, being careful not to overmix, as you want to maintain the crab's chunky texture.

2. **Shape the Crab Cakes:** Divide the mixture into 8 equal portions and shape each into a patty about 2 inches wide and 1-inch thick. If the mixture is too loose, you can add a little more panko to bind it together.

3. **Coat the Crab Cakes:** Lightly coat each crab cake with additional panko breadcrumbs on all sides. This will create a nice crispy crust.

4. **Chill the Patties:** Place the crab cakes on a tray and cover them with plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to overnight to help them firm up.

5. **Cook the Crab Cakes:** Melt the butter with the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the butter begins to foam, add the crab cakes, taking care not to crowd the skillet. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side or until golden brown and cooked through.

### To Make the Remoulade Sauce:
1. **Combine Ingredients:** In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, capers, pickles, garlic, hot sauce, smoked paprika, and lemon juice.

2. **Season and Serve:** Season the remoulade sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Serve chilled with the warm crab cakes.
