### California Cobb Salad Recipe

#### Ingredients:

- **For the Salad:**
  - 4 cups mixed greens (such as romaine, iceberg, and arugula)
  - 1 ripe avocado, diced
  - 4 slices bacon, cooked until crispy and crumbled
  - 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
  - 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
  - 2 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped
  - 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 12 oz)
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - Salt and pepper to taste

- **For the Dressing:**
  - 1/3 cup red wine vinegar
  - 2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
  - 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
  - 1 tablespoon honey
  - 1 garlic clove, minced
  - Salt and pepper to taste

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Grilled Chicken:**
   - Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.
   - Rub the chicken breasts with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
   - Grill for about 6-7 minutes on each side or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C).
   - Remove from grill and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Slice thinly and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Dressing:**
   - In a small mixing bowl, whisk together red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, and minced garlic.
   - Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while whisking continuously until well combined and emulsified.
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste. 

3. **Assemble the Salad:**
   - On a large platter or in a large salad bowl, spread the mixed greens evenly.
   - Arrange the grilled chicken slices, avocado, bacon, cherry tomatoes, blue cheese, and hard-boiled eggs over the greens in rows or sections for a traditional Cobb presentation.

4. **Serve:**
   - Drizzle the dressing over the salad just before serving, or serve the dressing on the side for individuals to add as desired.

5. **Wine Pairing:**
   - This salad pairs wonderfully with a Sauvignon Blanc, such as the Kim Crawford Signature Reserve 2020, which complements the dish’s rich flavors of avocado, bacon, and blue cheese.

**Chef’s Tip:** Make sure to use ripe avocados for the best texture and flavor. The kissed sweet and tangy dressing balances the saltiness of the bacon and the tang of the blue cheese, creating a well-rounded bite. Enjoy with a chilled glass of wine for a refreshing culinary experience.
