## Chilled Sweet Corn Velouté with Avocado Mousse and Chipotle-Infused Oil

This is a refreshing summer dish that beautifully balances the natural sweetness of corn with the creamy texture of avocado and a smoky kick from chipotle oil.

### Ingredients:

#### For the Corn Velouté:
- 6 ears of fresh sweet corn
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 4 cups vegetable stock
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- Salt and white pepper to taste
- Juice of 1 lime (optional)

#### For the Avocado Mousse:
- 2 ripe avocados
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- 2 tablespoons crème fraîche or sour cream
- Salt to taste

#### For the Chipotle-Infused Oil:
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1 dried chipotle pepper

### Instructions:

#### Prepare the Chipotle-Infused Oil:
1. In a small saucepan, heat the olive oil over low heat.
2. Add the dried chipotle pepper, ensuring it is fully submerged in the oil.
3. Allow the pepper to infuse for 20 minutes, then remove from heat and let it cool completely.
4. Strain the oil into a clean bottle or container, discarding the pepper. Set aside.

#### Make the Corn Velouté:
1. Shuck the corn and remove the kernels from the cobs. Scrape the cobs with the back of your knife to extract the "milk" and set aside.
2. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the diced onion and garlic, cooking until translucent.
3. Add the corn kernels and "milk" to the pot, stirring to combine.
4. Pour in the vegetable stock, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 20 minutes, until the corn is tender.
5. Remove from heat and use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth, or transfer in batches to a countertop blender.
6. Strain the soup through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean pot, pressing to extract as much liquid as possible.
7. Stir in the heavy cream and season with salt, white pepper, and lime juice (if using). Chill thoroughly in the refrigerator before serving.

#### Prepare the Avocado Mousse:
1. Halve the avocados, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a bowl.
2. Add lime juice and crème fraîche, and blend until smooth, using a food processor or immersion blender.
3. Season with salt and adjust for taste.
4. Transfer to a piping bag for easy serving.

### To Serve:
1. Ladle the chilled corn velouté into bowls.
2. Pipe or spoon the avocado mousse into the center of each bowl.
3. Drizzle with chipotle-infused oil for added flavor.
4. Garnish with microgreens or fresh herbs if desired.

### Wine Pairing:
Pair this dish with a glass of **Quintessa Illumination Sauvignon Blanc 2019**, whose crisp acidity and subtle minerality complement the sweet corn and the creamy avocado, adding a refreshing contrast to the subtle spiciness of the chipotle oil.
