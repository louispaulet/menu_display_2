#### Instructions

**1. Prepare Walnut Bread:**

- In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, salt, and yeast.
- Add warm water and honey, mix with a wooden spoon until a dough forms.
- Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
- Flatten the dough, scatter the chopped walnuts on top, then knead to incorporate evenly.
- Shape the dough into a ball, then place it in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth.
- Let it rise for 1 hour or until it doubles in size.
- Preheat the oven to 220°C (428°F).
- Punch down the risen dough, shape into a round loaf, and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
- Bake for 30-35 minutes or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.
- Cool on a wire rack.

**2. Prepare Quince Paste:**

- Cut the quinces into chunks. Place them in a large pot and cover with water.
- Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the quinces are very soft, about 40 minutes.
- Drain the quinces and puree them using a food processor or blender.
- Return the quince puree to the pot and add the sugar and lemon juice.
- Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and the color deepens to a reddish hue, approximately 1 hour. The paste should hold its shape.
- Line a baking dish with parchment paper, pour in the quince paste, and flatten the surface with a spatula.
- Allow to set for several hours or overnight.

**3. Plating the Cheese Course:**

- Arrange the selection of cheeses artistically on a large platter.
- Cut the quince paste into small squares and place them next to each cheese.
- Slice the walnut bread, lightly toasted if desired, and serve alongside the cheeses.

**4. Wine Pairing Suggestion:**

- Pour a glass of Sauternes Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey 2017, serving chilled, to accompany the dish. Its sweet and aromatic profile will beautifully contrast with the rich, creamy textures and flavors of the cheeses.
