### Instructions

#### Baked Cod Preparation
1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. **Prepare Marinade**: In a small bowl, whisk together the white miso paste, soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil, and honey.
3. **Marinate Cod**: Place the cod fillets in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them, ensuring each fillet is well coated. Allow to marinate for 15 minutes.
4. **Bake Cod**: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange cod fillets on the sheet and bake in the preheated oven for approximately 12-15 minutes, or until the fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.

#### Mushroom Duxelles Preparation
1. **Sauté Mushrooms**: Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the finely chopped mushrooms and sauté until they release their moisture, about 5 minutes.
2. **Add Aromatics**: Stir in the shallot, garlic, and thyme. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes until the mixture is dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

#### Sautéed Spinach Preparation
1. **Heat Oil**: In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat.
2. **Cook Spinach**: Add the sliced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant but not browned. Add the spinach and toss until wilted, about 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

### Plating the Dish
1. To serve, spoon a bed of sautéed spinach onto each plate.
2. Place a cod fillet on top of the spinach.
3. Spoon some mushroom duxelles over the cod.
4. Garnish with fresh thyme or chives if desired.

### Wine Pairing
- Pair this dish with a crisp Riesling, such as Domaine Weinbach Cuvée Ste. Catherine 2019, to complement the delicate flavors of the fish and the earthy notes of the mushrooms.
