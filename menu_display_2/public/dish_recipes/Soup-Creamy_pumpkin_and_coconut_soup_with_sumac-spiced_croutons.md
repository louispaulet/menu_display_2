## Ingredients

### For the Soup:
- 1 medium pumpkin (about 1.5 kg/3.3 lbs), peeled, seeded, and cubed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes
- 1 liter vegetable broth
- 1 can (400 ml) coconut milk
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- Juice of 1 lime

### For the Sumac-Spiced Croutons:
- 4 slices of day-old bread, cut into cubes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon sumac
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- Salt to taste

### Garnish:
- Fresh coriander leaves
- Toasted pumpkin seeds

## Instructions

### Prepare the Soup
1. **Roast the Pumpkin:** Preheat your oven to 200°C (390°F). Place the pumpkin cubes on a baking sheet, drizzle with a little olive oil, and roast for 30 minutes until soft and slightly caramelized.

2. **Cook the Aromatics:** In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until translucent, about 5-6 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and red pepper flakes. Cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant.

3. **Simmer the Soup:** Add the roasted pumpkin to the pot, pour in the vegetable broth, and bring to a simmer. Let it cook for about 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.

4. **Blend the Soup:** Remove the pot from heat and use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. Alternatively, blend in batches in a countertop blender.

5. **Add the Coconut Milk:** Stir in the coconut milk and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Gently reheat the soup over low heat, stirring occasionally.

### Prepare the Croutons
1. **Season the Bread:** In a mixing bowl, toss the bread cubes with olive oil, sumac, paprika, and a pinch of salt until evenly coated.

2. **Toast the Croutons:** Spread the bread cubes onto a baking sheet and toast in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes until golden and crisp.

### Serve
1. **Garnish the Soup:** Ladle the soup into bowls and top each with a handful of sumac-spiced croutons.

2. **Add Final Touches:** Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and a sprinkling of toasted pumpkin seeds.

3. **Enjoy** with a glass of Viognier Yves Cuilleron Les Vignes d'à Côté 2019, savoring how its richness complements the creaminess of the soup.
