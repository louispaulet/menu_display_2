# Grilled Pineapple with Rum Caramel Sauce and Vanilla Ice Cream

## Ingredients

### For the Grilled Pineapple:
- 1 whole ripe pineapple
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

### For the Rum Caramel Sauce:
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed
- 2 tablespoons dark rum
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt

### For Serving:
- Vanilla ice cream

## Instructions

### Prepare the Pineapple:
1. Cut off the top and bottom of the pineapple. Trim off the skin and remove the "eyes" from the fruit.
2. Slice the pineapple into rings, approximately 1/2 inch thick. Remove the core from each ring using a small round cutter or a paring knife.
3. In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar, melted butter, and cinnamon. Brush each pineapple ring generously with this mixture.

### Grill the Pineapple:
1. Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.
2. Place the pineapple rings on the grill. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until grill marks appear and the pineapple becomes tender.
3. Remove from the grill and set aside.

### Make the Rum Caramel Sauce:
1. In a medium saucepan, combine the granulated sugar and water. Cook over medium heat, swirling the pan occasionally until the sugar dissolves and the mixture turns a deep amber color (do not stir).
2. Once amber, carefully add the heavy cream (the mixture will bubble vigorously). Whisk until smooth.
3. Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the butter, rum, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix until the butter is fully incorporated and the sauce is smooth.
4. Allow the sauce to cool slightly; it will thicken as it cools.

### Assemble the Dessert:
1. Place a grilled pineapple ring on each serving plate.
2. Top each ring with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
3. Drizzle the warm rum caramel sauce over the ice cream and pineapple.
4. Optionally, sprinkle a bit of extra cinnamon on top for garnish.
5. Serve immediately with a glass of Ch√¢teau Suduiraut Sauternes 2015 to enhance the tropical and caramel flavors of the dessert.

Enjoy your luxurious tropical dessert experience!
