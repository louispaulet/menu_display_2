## Instructions

### Prepare the Semifreddo
1. **Whisk Egg Yolks and Sugar**: In a large heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (bain-marie) and continuously whisk until the mixture is pale, thick, and doubles in volume, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool.

2. **Beat the Cream**: In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.

3. **Blend Mascarpone**: Gently whisk the mascarpone into the cooled egg yolk mixture along with the coffee liqueur, salt, and vanilla extract until smooth.

4. **Combine Mixtures**: Carefully fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture with a spatula until fully combined, ensuring not to deflate the mixture.

5. **Chill**: Transfer into a loaf pan lined with plastic wrap or parchment paper. Smooth the top, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for at least 4 hours or until firm.

### Make the Espresso Sauce
1. **Combine and Cook**: In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the espresso, sugar, coffee liqueur, and corn syrup. Stir constantly until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Allow it to cool completely.

### Assemble and Serve
1. **Plating**: Remove the semifreddo from the freezer and let it sit for a few minutes. Invert it onto a serving dish, remove the plastic wrap, and dust with cocoa powder.

2. **Garnish**: Drizzle with the cooled espresso sauce, and scatter cocoa nibs and chocolate shavings over the top.

3. **Serve Immediately**: Slice with a warm knife and serve alongside a glass of Moscato d'Asti La Spinetta Bricco Quaglia 2020 to enhance the flavors of this elegant dessert.
