# Velvety Butternut Squash Bisque with Crème Fraîche and Sage Croutons

### Ingredients

#### For the Bisque:
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 large butternut squash (about 3 pounds), peeled, seeded, and cubed
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup apple cider
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup crème fraîche, plus more for garnish

#### For the Sage Croutons:
- 2 cups stale bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon fresh sage leaves, finely chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Sage Croutons:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the bread cubes, olive oil, chopped sage, salt, and pepper. Toss until the bread is evenly coated.
3. Spread the bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet.
4. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the croutons are golden brown and crisp. Remove and let cool.

#### Prepare the Bisque:
1. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
2. Add the chopped onion and garlic to the pot. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the cubed butternut squash to the pot and stir to combine with the onions and garlic.
4. Pour in the vegetable broth and apple cider, and bring the mixture to a boil.
5. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the pot, and cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the squash is tender.
6. Remove the pot from the heat. Use an immersion blender to purée the soup until smooth. Alternatively, carefully transfer the soup to a blender, blend until smooth, and return to the pot.
7. Stir in the nutmeg, salt, pepper, heavy cream, and crème fraîche. Heat the soup over low heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes.
8. Adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

### To Serve:
1. Ladle the hot bisque into bowls.
2. Top each bowl with a swirl of crème fraîche.
3. Garnish with sage croutons.

### Wine Pairing:
