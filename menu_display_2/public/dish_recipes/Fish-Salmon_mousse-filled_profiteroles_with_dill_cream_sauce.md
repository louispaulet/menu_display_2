## Instructions

### Making the Profiteroles

1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. **Prepare Dough**: In a medium saucepan, combine the water, butter, and salt over medium heat. Bring to a boil.

3. **Mix in Flour**: Remove from heat and quickly stir in the flour until it forms a smooth ball of dough.

4. **Incorporate Eggs**: Allow to cool for a minute, then beat in eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next.

5. **Shape Profiteroles**: Transfer dough to a piping bag with a large round tip. Pipe small mounds of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between them for expansion.

6. **Bake**: Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped.

7. **Cool**: Allow to cool completely on a wire rack.

### Preparing the Salmon Mousse

1. **Blend Ingredients**: In a food processor, combine smoked salmon, cream cheese, sour cream, lemon juice, and dill. Process until smooth.

2. **Season**: Add salt and pepper to taste.

3. **Fill Profiteroles**: Once the profiteroles are cool, gently cut a small hole in the base and pipe the salmon mousse into each one.

### Making the Dill Cream Sauce

1. **Simmer**: In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a simmer over medium heat.

2. **Add Ingredients**: Stir in dill and lemon juice, then season with salt and pepper.

3. **Thicken**: Keep at a simmer until slightly thickened, about 3-5 minutes.

### Serving

1. **Plate**: Arrange filled profiteroles on a serving platter.

2. **Sauce**: Drizzle dill cream sauce over the profiteroles.

3. **Garnish and Pair**: Garnish with extra dill, if desired, and serve alongside a glass of Chablis Domaine William Fèvre 2019.
