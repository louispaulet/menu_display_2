#### Ingredients

**Lobster:**
- 2 Maine lobster tails (about 8 oz each)
- 1 cup unsalted butter, cut into cubes
- 2 garlic cloves, smashed
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1 lemon, halved
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

**Parsnip Purée:**
- 1 lb parsnips, peeled and chopped
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- Salt, to taste
- White pepper, to taste

**Saffron Beurre Blanc:**
- 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads
- 1/4 cup white wine
- 1/4 cup white wine vinegar
- 2 shallots, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed
- Salt and freshly ground white pepper, to taste

**Garnish:**
- Microgreens (such as watercress or arugula)
- Edible flowers (optional)

#### Instructions

**Prepare the Parsnip Purée:**
1. In a medium saucepan, bring salted water to a boil. Add the chopped parsnips and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.
2. Drain the parsnips and transfer to a blender or food processor. Add butter and heavy cream, and blend until smooth.
3. Season with salt and white pepper to taste. Keep warm until ready to serve.

**Make the Saffron Beurre Blanc:**
1. In a small saucepan over low heat, combine saffron threads, wine, vinegar, and shallots. Reduce the mixture until about 2 tablespoons of liquid remains.
2. Gradually whisk in the cold butter, one cube at a time, until emulsified and thickened. Be careful not to overheat the mixture.
3. Season with salt and white pepper, passing through a fine sieve if desired. Keep warm.

**Butter-poach the Lobster:**
1. Preheat a sous-vide water bath to 140°F (60°C).
2. Season the lobster tails lightly with salt and pepper.
3. In a small saucepan, melt the butter with garlic and thyme over low heat. Once melted and aromatic, remove from the heat and let cool slightly.
4. Pour the butter into a vacuum-sealed bag or resealable plastic bag. Add the lobster tails.
5. Seal the bag using a vacuum sealer or the water displacement method for plastic bags.
6. Place the sealed bag in the sous-vide bath and cook for 45-60 minutes.
7. Once cooked, carefully remove the lobster from the butter bath and gently pat dry.

**To Serve:**
1. Artistic streak or spoon some parsnip purée onto the serving plate.
2. Carefully lay the butter-poached lobster on the purée.
3. Drizzle with the saffron beurre blanc.
4. Garnish with fresh microgreens and edible flowers, if using.

**Wine Pairing:** 
- Serve with a chilled glass of Chardonnay, such as the Peter Michael Ma Belle-Fille 2018, whose subtle oak and buttery notes complement the richness of the dish.

Enjoy your elegant appetizer that combines the fresh flavors of Maine lobster with the creamy depth of parsnip and the fragrant notes of saffron beurre blanc.
