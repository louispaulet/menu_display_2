# Smooth Artichoke Soup with Crispy Pancetta and Black Truffle Shavings

## Ingredients

- 6 large fresh artichokes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 medium potato, peeled and diced
- 4 cups chicken or vegetable stock
- 1 cup heavy cream
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1/4 cup shaved black truffles (or truffle oil as an alternative)
- 6 slices pancetta
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- Fresh parsley, chopped for garnish
- Lemon wedges

## Instructions

### Preparing the Artichokes
1. **Clean the Artichokes**: Remove the tough outer leaves of the artichokes and trim the stems. Cut the top third of the artichokes and scoop out the furry choke with a melon baller.
2. **Store in Lemon Water**: Place trimmed artichokes in a bowl of water with a few lemon wedges to prevent browning.

### Making the Soup
3. **Sauté the Aromatics**: Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, cooking until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
4. **Add Artichokes and Potato**: Drain the artichokes and coarsely chop them. Add them to the pot along with the diced potato. Stir to coat in the oil and cook for another 5 minutes.
5. **Simmer**: Pour in the chicken or vegetable stock, bringing it to a boil. Reduce heat to low and let it simmer until the artichokes and potato are tender, about 25–30 minutes.

### Blending and Finishing
6. **Blend the Soup**: Use an immersion blender or transfer to a countertop blender to puree the soup until smooth.
7. **Add Cream and Season**: Stir in the heavy cream, then season with salt and pepper to taste. If the soup is too thick, add a little more stock or water to reach your desired consistency.

### Preparing the Pancetta
8. **Crisp the Pancetta**: Meanwhile, in a small frying pan, cook the pancetta slices over medium heat until crispy, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

### Serving
9. **Presentation**: Ladle soup into bowls. Place a slice of crispy pancetta on top, then sprinkle with shaved truffles or drizzle with truffle oil.
10. **Garnish**: Add a sprinkle of fresh parsley as garnish. Serve with a lemon wedge on the side to bright up flavors.

## Wine Pairing
- **Pinot Grigio Livio Felluga Colli Orientali del Friuli 2020**: This Italian wine pairs perfectly with the delicate flavors of the artichoke and the rich creaminess of the soup, providing a refreshing contrast.

### Tips
- **Substitute**: If fresh artichokes are unavailable, canned or frozen hearts can be used.
- **Truffle Oil**: If black truffles are hard to source, a high-quality truffle oil can impart similar flavors to the dish.
