## Turbot with Champagne Sauce, Caviar, and Asparagus

### Ingredients

**For the Turbot:**
- 4 turbot fillets (about 150g each)
- Sea salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

**For the Champagne Sauce:**
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 150ml Champagne
- 200ml fish stock
- 150ml double cream
- 100g chilled unsalted butter, cubed
- Lemon juice, to taste
- Salt, to taste
- White pepper, to taste

**For the Garnish:**
- 1 bunch of asparagus, trimmed
- 20g high-quality caviar (e.g., Beluga or Oscietra)

### Method

1. **Prepare the Asparagus:**
   - Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Blanch the asparagus for about 2-3 minutes until tender yet crisp. Remove and plunge immediately into ice water to stop cooking. Drain and set aside.

2. **Cook the Turbot:**
   - Season the turbot fillets with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
   - Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a large non-stick frying pan.
   - Add the turbot fillets skin-side down. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the skin is crispy and golden brown. Flip and add 2 tablespoons of butter to the pan.
   - Baste the turbot with the melted butter for another 2-3 minutes until the fish is opaque and flaky. Remove from the pan and keep warm.

3. **Make the Champagne Sauce:**
   - In a saucepan, sweat the chopped shallot over medium heat until softened.
   - Add the Champagne and reduce by half.
   - Pour in the fish stock and reduce again by half.
   - Stir in the double cream and reduce to a creamy consistency.
   - Lower the heat to a simmer and whisk in the chilled butter, cube by cube, until emulsified and glossy.
   - Season with lemon juice, salt, and white pepper to taste. Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve to ensure smoothness.

4. **Plate the Dish:**
   - Place a portion of blanched asparagus onto each plate.
   - Lay the turbot fillet gently over the asparagus.
   - Spoon a generous amount of the Champagne sauce around the fish.
   - Top the turbot fillet with a small scoop of caviar.

5. **Serve:**
   - Serve immediately alongside a glass of well-chilled Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru Domaine Coche-Dury 2017 for a perfect pairing.
