# Artisanal Cheese Selection with Accompaniments

## Ingredients

### Cheese Selection
- 100g Brie de Meaux
- 100g Roquefort
- 100g Aged Comté
- 100g Manchego
- 100g Chevre (Goat Cheese)

### Fruit Preserves
- 50g Fig preserves
- 50g Apricot preserves

### Nuts
- 50g Marcona almonds, lightly toasted

### Bread
- 1 small loaf of walnut-raisin bread
- Optional: Freshly toasted or served as is

### Optional Garnishes
- A few sprigs of fresh rosemary or thyme

## Instructions

1. **Cheese Preparation** 
   - Remove all cheeses from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before serving to reach room temperature. This allows for optimal flavor and texture.
   - Arrange cheeses on a large wooden board or platter. Space them out to encourage guests to sample each individually.

2. **Preparation of Preserves and Nuts**
   - Spoon fig and apricot preserves into small ramekins or dishes, and place these strategically around the cheeses.
   - Scatter the toasted Marcona almonds around the cheese board or place them in a separate small dish.

3. **Bread Slicing** 
   - Slice the walnut-raisin bread into thin pieces. You can toast the slices for additional texture and warmth or serve them fresh as is. Arrange these around the cheeses and preserves.

4. **Final Plating**
   - Optionally garnish the board with fresh rosemary or thyme.
   - Serve immediately, encouraging guests to create their own pairings with cheese, preserves, almonds, and bread.

## Wine Pairing
- Serve with a chilled glass of *Château d'Yquem Sauternes 2009*. The wine’s rich, honeyed complexity and acid balance will complement the creamy and tangy notes of the cheeses as well as enhance the sweetness of the preserves.

### Note
- Selection of cheeses should be guided by season and availability. Feel free to substitute with equally artisanal local cheeses based on preference or access. Bon appétit!
