### Chè Chuối (Banana and Tapioca Pudding with Coconut Milk and Toasted Peanuts)

**Ingredients:**

- 4 ripe bananas, peeled and sliced into 1-inch rounds
- 1 1/4 cups mini tapioca pearls
- 4 cups water
- 2 cups coconut milk
- 1 cup coconut cream
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup toasted peanuts, roughly chopped
- Fresh mint leaves, for garnish

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare Tapioca Pearls:**
   - In a medium pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the tapioca pearls and stir frequently to prevent sticking. Cook for about 15-20 minutes or until the pearls are translucent and chewy.
   - Drain the tapioca pearls and rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside.

2. **Cook the Pudding Base:**
   - In another pot, combine the coconut milk, coconut cream, sugar, and salt. Stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves completely.
   - Once dissolved, add the vanilla extract.

3. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Add the sliced bananas and cooked tapioca pearls to the coconut milk mixture. Stir gently to avoid mashing the bananas.
   - Allow the mixture to simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the bananas are tender and the flavors have melded well together.

4. **Serve:**
   - Remove the pot from heat and let the pudding cool for a few minutes.
   - Scoop the chè chuối into individual serving bowls. Sprinkle each serving with a generous amount of toasted peanuts.
   - Garnish with fresh mint leaves for a touch of freshness and color.

5. **Wine Pairing:**
   - Serve with a glass of Sauternes Château Guiraud 2017, which complements the pudding’s tropical and nutty flavors with its elegant sweetness.

**Notes:**
- Adjust the sweetness to your preference by adding more or less sugar.
- Ensure that the bananas used are ripe for a natural sweetness and tender texture.
- For a nut-free version, omit the peanuts or substitute with toasted coconut flakes.
