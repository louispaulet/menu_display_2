### Seared Scallops with Jamón Ibérico and Yuzu Miso Sauce

#### Ingredients

**For the Scallops:**
- 12 large sea scallops, pat dry
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 4 thin slices of Jamón Ibérico

**For the Yuzu Miso Sauce:**
- 2 tablespoons white miso paste
- 2 tablespoons mirin
- 1 tablespoon yuzu juice (can substitute with lemon if unavailable)
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon water

**To Garnish:**
- Fresh microgreens or chives, finely chopped
- Lemon zest

#### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Yuzu Miso Sauce:**
   - In a small saucepan, combine the white miso paste, mirin, yuzu juice, soy sauce, sugar, and water.
   - Heat gently over medium-low heat, stirring continuously, until the sauce becomes smooth and slightly thickened. Remove from heat and set aside.

2. **Cook the Scallops:**
   - Season the scallops with salt and pepper on both sides.
   - Heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the scallops in a single layer.
   - Sear the scallops for about 2 minutes on one side until a golden crust forms.
   - Flip the scallops and sear the other side for another 2 minutes until fully cooked but still tender on the inside. Remove from heat.

3. **Crisp the Jamón Ibérico:**
   - In a separate small pan over medium heat, add the slices of Jamón Ibérico.
   - Sear lightly on both sides until they become crispy but not burnt. This should take about 1-2 minutes. Set aside on a paper towel to absorb excess oil.

4. **Plate the Dish:**
   - On each plate, artistically drizzle a spoonful of the yuzu miso sauce.
   - Arrange 3 scallops on top of the sauce.
   - Break the crispy Jamón Ibérico into shards and place creatively around the scallops.
   - Garnish with fresh microgreens or chives and a sprinkle of lemon zest for an aromatic finish.

5. **Pairing Suggestion:**
   - Serve this elegant appetizer with a chilled glass of Albariño Do Ferreiro Cepas Vellas 2019 to complement the flavors and acidity in the dish.
