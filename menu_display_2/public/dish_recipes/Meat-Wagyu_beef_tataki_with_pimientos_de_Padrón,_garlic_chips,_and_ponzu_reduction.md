## Instructions

### Preparing the Wagyu Beef Tataki
1. **Seasoning and Searing**: Season the chilled Wagyu tenderloin with salt and pepper. **Heat** a non-stick pan over high heat. Sear all sides of the beef for 30 seconds to 1 minute, ensuring the inside remains rare.
2. **Rest and Chill**: Remove the beef and set aside to rest. Once cool, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to firm the beef for slicing.

### Making the Garlic Chips
1. **Heating Oil**: In a small saucepan, **heat** vegetable oil over medium heat.
2. **Fry Garlic**: Add garlic slices and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 2 minutes. **Remove** with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

### Preparing the Ponzu Reduction
1. **Combine Ingredients**: Mix soy sauce, mirin, yuzu juice, sake, sugar, ginger, and minced garlic in a small saucepan.
2. **Reduce**: Heat gently and reduce until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. **Strain** and cool.

### Preparing the Pimientos de Padrón
1. **Cooking Peppers**: In a pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add pimientos and sauté until blistered and slightly charred, about 3-4 minutes. **Season** generously with sea salt.

### Assembling the Dish
1. **Slice Beef**: Unwrap beef and slice thinly against the grain.
2. **Plating**: Arrange slices of Wagyu beef on a platter, interspersed with garlic chips and blistered Padrón peppers.
3. **Drizzle Ponzu**: Drizzle lightly with ponzu reduction.
4. **Garnish**: Sprinkle with thinly sliced scallions and toasted sesame seeds.
