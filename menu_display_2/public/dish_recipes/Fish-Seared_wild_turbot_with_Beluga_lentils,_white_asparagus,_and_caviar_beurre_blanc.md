#### Instructions

**1. Preparing the Beluga Lentils:**
   1. Rinse the lentils under cold running water. Drain and set aside.
   2. Heat the olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat.
   3. Add the carrot, onion, celery, and garlic. Sauté until the vegetables are soft but not browned, around 5 minutes.
   4. Add the lentils and stir to coat in the oil and vegetables.
   5. Pour in vegetable broth and add the bay leaf.
   6. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook for about 25-30 minutes or until the lentils are tender.
   7. Remove the bay leaf, add sherry vinegar, and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.

**2. Preparing the White Asparagus:**
   1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
   2. Add the peeled white asparagus spears and blanch for about 5-7 minutes until tender but with a slight bite.
   3. Drain and immediately place in ice water to stop cooking.
   4. Before serving, melt butter in a pan over medium heat and gently warm the asparagus.

**3. Preparing the Caviar Beurre Blanc:**
   1. In a small saucepan, combine white wine, lemon juice, and shallot.
   2. Cook over medium heat until the liquid is reduced to about 2 tablespoons.
   3. Reduce the heat to low and gradually whisk in the chilled butter, piece by piece, to emulsify.
   4. Strain the sauce into a clean pan, season with salt, and keep warm.
   5. Right before serving, gently fold in the caviar.

**4. Cooking the Turbot:**
   1. Pat the turbot fillets dry with paper towels, and season with salt and white pepper.
   2. Heat the grapeseed oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
   3. Add the turbot fillets, skin-side down, and sear for about 3-4 minutes until the skin is crispy.
   4. Turn the fillets over, add the tablespoon of butter to the pan, and continue to cook for 1-2 minutes, basting with butter.
   5. Remove from the pan and let rest for a minute.

**5. Plating:**
   1. Place a serving of Beluga lentils in the center of each warm plate.
   2. Arrange three spears of white asparagus alongside the lentils.
   3. Position the seared turbot on top of the lentils.
   4. Spoon the caviar beurre blanc around the plate.
   5. Garnish with micro herbs if desired.

### Wine Pairing
- **Suggested Wine:** Château Margaux Blanc 2016. Its full body and subtle citrus notes beautifully complement the richness of the caviar beurre blanc and the delicate flavor of the turbot.

Enjoy your culinary masterpiece!
