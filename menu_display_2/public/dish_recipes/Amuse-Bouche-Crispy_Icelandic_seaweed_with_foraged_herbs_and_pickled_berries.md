### Crispy Icelandic Seaweed with Foraged Herbs and Pickled Berries

#### Ingredients:

- **Crispy Seaweed**
  - 150g Icelandic seaweed (dried)
  - 200ml light olive oil for frying
  - Sea salt to taste
  
- **Foraged Herbs**
  - A handful of fresh seasonal herbs (such as wild thyme, fennel fronds, sorrel)
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 tsp lemon juice
  - Pinch of salt

- **Pickled Berries**
  - 100g mixed wild berries (bilberries, lingonberries)
  - 50ml apple cider vinegar
  - 50ml water
  - 50g granulated sugar
  - 1 tsp mustard seeds
  - 1 bay leaf

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Seaweed**
   - Heat the olive oil in a small, deep pan until it reaches about 180°C (350°F).
   - Gently add the dried seaweed to the oil and fry for about 30 seconds or until crispy. It should not brown.
   - Remove the seaweed with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
   - Season lightly with sea salt while still warm.

2. **Prepare the Pickled Berries**
   - In a small saucepan, combine apple cider vinegar, water, sugar, mustard seeds, and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer, stirring until the sugar dissolves.
   - Remove from heat and pour over the mixed berries in a heatproof bowl. Ensure all berries are submerged.
   - Let sit for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours in the refrigerator for better flavor penetration.

3. **Prepare the Foraged Herbs**
   - Wash and dry the herbs thoroughly.
   - In a mixing bowl, combine the herbs with olive oil, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt. Toss gently to coat.

4. **Assembly**
   - Arrange the crispy seaweed on small serving plates or spoons.
   - Top with a small bunch of the foraged herbs, leaving some seaweed visible around the edges.
   - Scatter a few pickled berries over the top for contrast and a burst of acidity.
   - Serve immediately as a delightful amuse-bouche accompanied by a glass of Champagne Billecart-Salmon Brut Réserve for a refreshing start.

#### Notes:
- Ensure the seaweed is thoroughly dried before frying to achieve optimum crispiness.
- You can substitute with any available seasonal herbs or berries if preferred. 
- The pickled berries can be prepared a day in advance to enhance their flavor.
