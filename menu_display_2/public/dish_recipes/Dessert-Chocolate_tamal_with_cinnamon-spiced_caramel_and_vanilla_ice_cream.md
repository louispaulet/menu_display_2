### Chocolate Tamal with Cinnamon-spiced Caramel and Vanilla Ice Cream

**Serves:** 4

#### Ingredients

**For the Chocolate Tamal:**
- 1 cup masa harina
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1/4 cup vegetable shortening, softened
- 1 cup warm water
- 4 dried corn husks, soaked in water until pliable

**For the Cinnamon-spiced Caramel:**
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon

**For Garnish:**
- 4 scoops vanilla ice cream
- Optional: chocolate shavings or cinnamon sticks

#### Instructions

**Prepare the Chocolate Tamal:**

1. **Mix the Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, sift together the masa harina, cocoa powder, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt.

2. **Blend the Fats:** In another bowl, beat the softened butter and vegetable shortening until creamy and uniform in texture.

3. **Combine Ingredients:** Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the beaten fats, alternating with warm water. The mixture should be thick but pliable.

4. **Assemble the Tamales:** Drain the corn husks and pat them dry. Spread about 1/3 cup of tamale dough in the center of each husk. Fold the sides of the husks in and then fold the pointed end over the seam to form a packet.

5. **Steam the Tamales:** Place the tamales in a steamer upright and cover. Steam for about 45-60 minutes, or until the masa has set and separates easily from the husks.

**Prepare the Cinnamon-Spiced Caramel:**

1. **Caramelize the Sugar:** In a medium saucepan, heat the sugar over medium heat, stirring continuously, until it melts into a gold-brown liquid.

2. **Add the Cream and Butter:** Carefully whisk in the heavy cream (be cautious of splatters). Add the butter and stir until smooth.

3. **Spice It Up:** Stir in the cinnamon and remove from heat. Let it cool slightly before serving.

**Serve the Dessert:**

1. **Plate:** Unwrap the steamed chocolate tamales and place each on a dessert plate. 

2. **Garnish:** Drizzle the cinnamon-spiced caramel over the tamales and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.

3. **Optional Garnish:** Add a few chocolate shavings or a cinnamon stick for extra flair.

**Wine Pairing:** Best served with Pedro Xim√©nez Emilio Hidalgo Gobernador for a luscious finish.
