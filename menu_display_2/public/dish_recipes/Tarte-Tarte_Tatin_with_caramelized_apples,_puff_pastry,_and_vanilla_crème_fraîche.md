## Tarte Tatin

### Ingredients

#### Caramelized Apples
- 6 large Granny Smith apples
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

#### Puff Pastry
- 1 sheet of puff pastry, thawed (if using store-bought)

#### Vanilla Crème Fraîche
- 1 cup crème fraîche
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon powdered sugar

### Equipment
- 9-inch ovenproof skillet or tarte tatin dish
- Rolling pin
- Pastry board
- Mandoline slicer (optional)

### Instructions

#### Caramelizing the Apples
1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Prepare the Apples**: Peel, core, and cut the apples into quarters. Optionally, use a mandoline slicer for even quartering.

3. **Make the Caramel**: In the ovenproof skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the sugar, stirring gently until it dissolves into a golden caramel. Be cautious not to burn the sugar.

4. **Add Apples to Caramel**: Arrange the apple quarters in the skillet, placing them upright, snugly packed together, and continue to cook for about 10 minutes. Turn the apples occasionally to ensure they are evenly coated in caramel.

5. **Add Lemon Juice**: Once the apples are well-coated and caramelized and the caramel is a deep amber color, sprinkle the lemon juice over the apples.

#### Assemble the Tarte
6. **Roll Out the Pastry**: On a lightly floured pastry board, roll out the puff pastry to a size slightly larger than the skillet.

7. **Top the Apples**: Lay the pastry over the apples, tucking in the edges around the apples carefully.

8. **Bake the Tarte Tatin**: Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes or until the pastry is puffed and golden brown.

#### Make the Vanilla Crème Fraîche
9. **Prepare the Crème**: While the tarte is baking, combine crème fraîche, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar in a bowl. Stir until smooth and refrigerate until ready to use.

#### Serve
10. **Invert and Serve**: Remove the skillet from the oven, and allow it to cool slightly (about 5 minutes) before carefully inverting it onto a serving plate. Be cautious, as the caramel is extremely hot.

11. **Garnish**: Serve the tarte tatin warm, accompanied by a dollop of vanilla crème fraîche on the side.

### Wine Pairing
For an excellent dining experience, pair this tarte tatin with a glass of **Château Suduiraut Sauternes 2016**. The dessert wine's rich sweetness and acidity complement the caramelized apples perfectly.
