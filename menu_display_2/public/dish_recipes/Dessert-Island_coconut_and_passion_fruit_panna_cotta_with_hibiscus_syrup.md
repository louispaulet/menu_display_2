- **Heavy cream** - 200 ml
- **Caster sugar** - 100 g
- **Gelatin leaves** - 4 (or substitute with 2 teaspoons of powdered gelatin)
- **Vanilla extract** - 1 teaspoon
- **Passion fruit pulp** - 100 ml (from about 5 passion fruits)

- **Water** - 250 ml
- **Caster sugar** - 200 g
- **Lemon juice** - 1 tablespoon

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Panna Cotta
1. **Bloom the Gelatin:**
   - Soak the gelatin leaves in cold water for about 5 minutes until soft. If using powdered gelatin, dissolve it in a little cold water.

2. **Heat the Milk and Cream:**
   - In a saucepan, combine coconut milk, heavy cream, and sugar. Stir over low heat until the sugar has dissolved, do not boil.

3. **Add Vanilla and Gelatin:**
   - Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Squeeze excess water from the gelatin leaves and add them (or the dissolved powdered gelatin) to the warm mixture. Stir until completely dissolved.

4. **Incorporate Passion Fruit:**
   - Once cooled slightly, stir in the passion fruit pulp.

5. **Set the Panna Cotta:**
   - Pour the mixture into greased individual molds or ramekins. 
   - Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until set.

#### Prepare the Hibiscus Syrup
1. **Simmer the Hibiscus:**
   - In a small pot, bring water and hibiscus flowers to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes until the liquid is deeply colored.

2. **Make the Syrup:**
   - Strain the hibiscus infusion into another saucepan, discarding the flowers. Add sugar and lemon juice to the liquid.
   - Return to heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until it reaches a syrupy consistency (about 10-15 minutes).
   - Allow to cool completely.

### Assembly
1. **Unmold Panna Cotta:**
   - Dip the base of each mold in hot water for a few seconds before turning it onto a serving plate to unmold the panna cotta.

2. **Serve with Hibiscus Syrup:**
   - Drizzle a generous amount of hibiscus syrup over the panna cotta and sprinkle with lightly toasted desiccated coconut.

3. **Garnish:**
   - Optionally garnish with a mint leaf or edible flowers for color.
