## Instructions

### Osso Buco
1. **Prepare the Veal Shanks:** Season the veal shanks with salt and pepper. Dredge them in flour, shaking off any excess.
2. **Sear the Shanks:** In a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the shanks and brown on all sides. Remove and set aside.
3. **Cook the Vegetables:** In the same pot, add the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
4. **Deglaze and Simmer:** Pour in the white wine and allow it to reduce by half. Stir in beef stock, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, thyme, and bay leaf. Return the shanks to the pot, submerging them in the liquid.
5. **Simmer to Perfection:** Cover and simmer on low heat for 2 to 2.5 hours, until the meat is tender and falling off the bone.

### Gremolata
1. Mix the parsley, lemon zest, and garlic in a small bowl. Set aside to garnish just before serving.

### Truffle-Infused Polenta
1. **Boil Water:** Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add salt.
2. **Cook Polenta:** Gradually whisk in the polenta, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Reduce heat to low, cover the pan, and simmer for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. **Finish Polenta:** Stir in Parmesan cheese, butter, and truffle oil. Adjust seasoning with salt, if necessary.

### Barolo Demi-Glace
1. **Reduce Wine:** In a small saucepan, bring the Barolo wine and shallots to a boil. Cook until the wine is reduced by half.
2. **Create Demi-Glace:** Add beef stock and let it reduce by half again.
3. **Thicken and Finish:** Stir in the butter and thicken with the cornstarch mixture. Season with salt and pepper.

## Assembly
1. Serve the osso buco over a bed of truffle-infused polenta, drizzled with the Barolo demi-glace. Sprinkle with the gremolata just before serving.
2. Pair with a glass of Amarone della Valpolicella Quintarelli Riserva 2009 for an exquisite dining experience.
