# Lobster Bisque with Saffron and Cognac

## Ingredients

- 2 live lobsters (about 1 1/2 pounds each)
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 carrot, chopped
- 1 stalk celery, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup cognac
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon saffron threads
- 4 cups fish stock or water
- 1 cup heavy cream
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch (optional, for thickening)
- Fresh chives or parsley to garnish

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Lobster:**
   - Fill a large pot with salted water and bring to a boil. Add the lobsters to the pot, cover, and cook for about 8-10 minutes. Remove the lobsters and set aside to cool.
   - Once cool, crack the shells, remove the meat, and set it aside. Save the shells for the stock.

2. **Make the Lobster Stock:**
   - In the same pot, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
   - Add the chopped onion, carrot, celery, and garlic. Cook until the vegetables are soft but not browned, about 5-7 minutes.
   - Stir in the lobster shells, then add the cognac and ignite carefully (step back to avoid singeing).
   - Once the flames subside, add the white wine, tomato paste, saffron, and enough water or fish stock to cover the shells.
   - Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 30 minutes.
   - Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing down on the solids to extract every drop of flavor.

3. **Prepare the Bisque:**
   - In a separate pot, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
   - Slowly pour in the strained lobster stock, stirring constantly.
   - Add the heavy cream and bring to a gentle simmer. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
   - If you prefer a thicker bisque, dissolve cornstarch in a small amount of cold water and whisk into the bisque.

4. **Serve the Bisque:**
   - Chop the reserved lobster meat into bite-sized pieces and add to the bisque, heating gently.
   - Ladle the bisque into bowls, garnishing with freshly chopped chives or parsley.

## Wine Pairing

Serve with Ch√¢teau-Grillet 2015, a fine white wine that complements the richness of the bisque beautifully.
