### Instructions

#### Step 1: Make the Coconut Crepes
1. **Blend the Pandan Milk:**
   - Blend the pandan leaves with coconut milk in a blender until smooth.
   - Strain the mixture through a fine sieve to extract the green pandan-flavored milk.

2. **Prepare the Crepe Batter:**
   - In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, eggs, sugar, and salt.
   - Gradually add in the pandan milk while whisking continuously to attain a smooth batter.
   - Stir in the vegetable oil and a few drops of green food coloring if using.
   - Let the batter rest for about 15 minutes.

3. **Cook the Crepes:**
   - Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and lightly grease it.
   - Pour a small ladleful of batter onto the pan, swirling to form a thin layer.
   - Cook until the edges lift and the crepe is set, about 1-2 minutes.
   - Flip to cook the other side for about 30 seconds.
   - Repeat with remaining batter.

#### Step 2: Prepare the Coconut Filling
1. **Cook the Filling:**
   - In a saucepan, combine grated coconut, grated palm sugar, water, and salt.
   - Cook over medium heat, stirring regularly, until the mixture thickens and clumps together, about 8-10 minutes.
   - Allow to cool.

#### Step 3: Make the Palm Sugar Syrup
1. **Cook the Syrup:**
   - Combine the grated palm sugar, water, and pandan leaf in a saucepan.
   - Cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves and the mixture thickens slightly.
   - Remove from heat and discard the pandan leaf.

#### Step 4: Assemble & Serve
1. **Fill the Crepes:**
   - Place a spoonful of coconut filling at one end of each crepe.
   - Roll up the crepes tightly to encase the filling.

2. **Serve:**
   - Arrange the filled crepes on a serving plate.
   - Drizzle generously with palm sugar syrup.
   - Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.
