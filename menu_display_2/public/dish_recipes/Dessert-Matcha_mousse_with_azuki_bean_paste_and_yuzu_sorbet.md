## Instructions

### Matcha Mousse
1. **Prepare Matcha**: In a small bowl, whisk matcha powder with hot water to form a smooth paste. Set aside.

2. **Gelatin Preparation**: Soak gelatin sheets in cold water until soft. In a small saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of water and dissolve the softened gelatin in it. Allow to cool slightly.

3. **Cream Mixture**: In a bowl, beat egg yolks with sugar until pale and thick. Whip the heavy cream with vanilla extract until soft peaks form.

4. **Combine Ingredients**: Slowly fold the matcha paste and melted gelatin into the yolk mixture until fully integrated. Gently fold in the whipped cream until smooth. Divide the mixture into dessert cups and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or until set.

### Azuki Bean Paste
1. **Bean Preparation**: Rinse azuki beans and soak in water overnight.

2. **Cook Beans**: Drain and rinse again. Add beans and 3 cups of water to a pot, bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer. Cook for about 1-1.5 hours or until beans are soft, adding more water if necessary.

3. **Sweeten Beans**: Drain excess water and transfer beans back to the pot. Stir in sugar and salt. Simmer on low heat, stirring frequently, until a thick paste forms. Let it cool completely.

### Yuzu Sorbet
1. **Syrup Preparation**: In a small saucepan, combine sugar, water, and yuzu zest. Heat until sugar dissolves completely. Let it cool, then mix in yuzu juice.

2. **Freeze**: Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Alternatively, pour into a shallow dish and freeze, stirring every 30 minutes until fully set.
