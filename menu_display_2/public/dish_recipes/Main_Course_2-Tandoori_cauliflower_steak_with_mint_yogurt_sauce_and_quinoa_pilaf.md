## Instructions

### Tandoori Cauliflower Steak
1. **Preparation**: Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. **Yogurt Marinade**: In a bowl, combine Greek yogurt, tandoori masala, cumin, coriander, turmeric, garlic paste, ginger paste, salt, and lemon juice. Mix well.
3. **Cauliflower Slicing**: Cut the cauliflower into thick slices, about 1.5 inches.
4. **Coating**: Brush the cauliflower slices with olive oil on both sides. Then, coat them with the prepared yogurt marinade, ensuring an even coating. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.
5. **Baking**: Place marinated cauliflower steaks on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 40–45 minutes, or until golden brown and tender, flipping halfway through.

### Mint Yogurt Sauce
1. **Combine Ingredients**: In a small bowl, mix together Greek yogurt, mint leaves, lime juice, cumin powder, and salt. Stir until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

### Quinoa Pilaf
1. **Cooking Quinoa**: Rinse quinoa under cold water. In a medium saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Sauté onions and garlic until translucent. Add quinoa and toast for 2–3 minutes.
2. **Simmer**: Add vegetable broth and salt to the saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes or until quinoa is fluffy and broth is absorbed.
3. **Finishing Touches**: Remove from heat, fold in toasted almonds and cranberries. Fluff with a fork.
