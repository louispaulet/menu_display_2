- **For the Mint-Infused Syrup:**
  - 1/2 cup granulated sugar
  - 1/4 cup water
  - 1/4 cup fresh lime juice
  - 1 bunch fresh mint

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Mint-Infused Syrup:**
   - In a small saucepan, combine granulated sugar and water over medium heat.
   - Stir until sugar dissolves completely, then bring to a simmer.
   - Add fresh mint leaves and lime juice, reduce heat to low, and let simmer for 10 minutes.
   - Remove from heat, strain the syrup into a bowl, and let it cool completely.

2. **Prepare the Fruit Carpaccio:**
   - On a large serving platter, arrange the thin slices of mango, pineapple, kiwi, dragon fruit, and papaya in a beautiful pattern.
   - Ensure the slices slightly overlap each other to create the carpaccio effect.

3. **Assembly:**
   - Generously drizzle the cooled mint-infused syrup over the fruit slices.
   - Sprinkle the lime zest evenly across the dish.
   - Garnish with fresh mint leaves for a burst of color and flavor.

4. **Serving:**
   - Refrigerate the fruit carpaccio for at least 30 minutes before serving to enhance the flavors.
   - Serve chilled as a refreshing appetizer, ideally paired with Domaine Huet Vouvray Moelleux Le Mont 2019.

**Tips:**
- For an added crunch, lightly toast some coconut flakes and sprinkle them over the carpaccio just before serving.
- To enhance the presentation, serve the carpaccio on a chilled sheet of slate or marble.
