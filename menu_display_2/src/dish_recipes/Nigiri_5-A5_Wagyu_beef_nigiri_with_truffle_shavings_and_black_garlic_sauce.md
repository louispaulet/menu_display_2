- **300g sushi rice**
- **2 tbsp rice vinegar**
- **1 tbsp sugar**
- **1 tsp salt**
- **30g fresh truffle, thinly shaved**
- **50g black garlic**
- **4 tbsp soy sauce**
- **1 tbsp mirin**
- **Wasabi paste, to taste**
- **Pickled ginger, for serving**
- **Fresh microgreens, for garnish**

### Equipment

- Sushi rolling mat
- Sharp knife
- Saucepan
- Bamboo sushi rolling mat
- Mixing bowl
- Small saucepan

### Black Garlic Sauce

1. **Prepare the Black Garlic Sauce:**
   - Peel the black garlic and mash it into a paste using a fork.
   - In a small saucepan, combine the black garlic paste, soy sauce, and mirin.
   - Heat gently over medium-low heat, stirring until the mixture is well-combined and slightly thickened.
   - Set aside to cool.

### Sushi Rice

2. **Prepare the Sushi Rice:**
   - Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
   - Cook the rice according to package instructions.
   - Once cooked, spread the rice onto a large plate or wooden tub.
   - In a small bowl, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved.
   - Gradually fold the vinegar mixture into the rice using a wooden spatula, taking care not to mash the rice.
   - Allow to cool completely to room temperature.

### Assembly of Nigiri

3. **Shape the Nigiri:**
   - Wet your hands with a mixture of water and a little bit of rice vinegar to prevent sticking.
   - Take about 20-30g of sushi rice and form it into an oval shape by pressing lightly between your palms.
   - Cover the rice base with a thin slice of A5 Wagyu beef, pressing it gently onto the rice.

4. **Final Touches:**
   - Use a blowtorch or a hot grill to sear the tops of the Wagyu beef slices, just until they are slightly caramelized.
   - Top each nigiri with a small dab of wasabi and a couple of fresh truffle shavings.
   - Drizzle with a hint of the black garlic sauce.
   - Garnish with fresh microgreens.

5. **Serve:**
   - Arrange the nigiri elegantly on a serving plate.
   - Serve with pickled ginger and additional black garlic sauce on the side.

### Wine Pairing

- **Wine Recommendation:** Serve with Kubota Senju Ginjo, which complements the rich, umami flavors of the Wagyu and truffle with its clean, crisp profile.
