- 1/4 cup (60 g) unsalted butter, cubed
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (65 g) all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten

#### For the Goat Cheese Mousse
- 5 oz (140 g) fresh goat cheese, room temperature
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon honey
- Salt and pepper to taste

#### For the Filling
- 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes, finely chopped
- A handful of fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced
- Olive oil for drizzling

### Instructions

#### Making the Éclair Pastry
1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. **Prepare Choux**: In a medium saucepan, combine water, butter, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, ensuring butter is completely melted.

3. **Incorporate Flour**: Remove from heat and add flour all at once. Return to heat, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon until mixture forms a ball that pulls away from the sides of the pan.

4. **Cool & Beat In Eggs**: Transfer dough to a mixing bowl and let cool slightly. Add eggs, a little at a time, beating well after each addition, until the dough is smooth and glossy.

5. **Pipe Pastry**: Transfer dough to a piping bag fitted with a large plain nozzle. Pipe 2-3 inch logs onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each.

6. **Bake Éclairs**: Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350°F (180°C) and bake for 10 more minutes or until golden brown. **Do not open the oven door during baking.** Allow to cool on a wire rack.

#### Making the Goat Cheese Mousse
1. **Blend Ingredients**: In a bowl, whisk together goat cheese, heavy cream, and honey until smooth.

2. **Season**: Add salt and pepper to taste and whisk until the mixture holds soft peaks.

3. **Transfer**: Spoon the mousse into a clean piping bag fitted with a small tip for filling.

#### Assembling the Éclair
1. **Prepare the Éclairs**: Slice each éclair in half lengthwise, keeping the top and bottom connected slightly on one end like a hinge.

2. **Fill**: Pipe goat cheese mousse into each éclair base.

3. **Add Tomatoes and Basil**: Evenly distribute the sun-dried tomatoes and basil over the mousse.

4. **Drizzle with Olive Oil**: Lightly drizzle olive oil on top for added flavor.

#### Serve
- **Wine Pairing**: Pair with a chilled glass of Sancerre Domaine Vacheron 2020 to complement and enhance the flavors of the goat cheese and tomatoes.

Enjoy crafting this delightful appetizer that combines creamy, tangy flavors with a hint of freshness, perfect for starting your gastronomical experience.
