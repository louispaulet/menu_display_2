## Instructions

### Fig Marmalade
1. Place figs, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, cinnamon, and water in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
2. Bring to a simmer and reduce to low heat, cooking for 30-40 minutes until the mixture thickens. Stir occasionally.
3. Let the marmalade cool, then transfer it to an airtight container. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.

### Rosemary Focaccia
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and yeast. Make a well in the center and add the warm water and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
2. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
3. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.
4. Preheat the oven to 220°C (428°F).
5. Once risen, punch down the dough and transfer it to a 9x13-inch baking pan lined with parchment paper.
6. Stretch it gently to fill the pan, drizzle with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, sprinkle with chopped rosemary and coarse sea salt.
7. Use your fingers to dimple the surface of the dough.
8. Cover and let it rise again for about 20 minutes.
9. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.
10. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing.

### Assembly
1. Arrange the selection of Italian cheeses on a large serving platter.
2. Add a small bowl of fig marmalade in the center.
3. Slice the rosemary focaccia into squares or strips and arrange them around the cheeses.
4. Garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs.
5. Drizzle a touch of olive oil over the platter for extra flavor.

## Wine Pairing
