## Kale and Roasted Sweet Potato Salad with Pomegranate Seeds and Tahini Dressing

### Ingredients

#### For the Salad:
- 2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste
- 1 bunch kale, ribs removed and leaves chopped
- 1 cup pomegranate seeds
- 1/3 cup roasted pepitas (pumpkin seeds)

#### For the Tahini Dressing:
- 1/4 cup tahini
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons water (or more as needed for thinning)
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste

### Instructions

1. **Roast the Sweet Potatoes**
   - Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
   - Place the sweet potato cubes on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat evenly.
   - Roast in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until sweet potatoes are tender and slightly caramelized, flipping halfway through for even cooking.

2. **Prepare the Kale**
   - While the sweet potatoes are roasting, place the chopped kale in a large bowl. Drizzle with a small amount of olive oil and a pinch of salt. Massage the kale with your hands for about 2-3 minutes until it becomes tender and slightly wilted.

3. **Make the Tahini Dressing**
   - In a small bowl, whisk together the tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup, minced garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
   - Add water a tablespoon at a time until the dressing reaches your desired consistency. It should be smooth and pourable.
   
4. **Assemble the Salad**
   - Once the sweet potatoes are roasted, allow them to cool slightly.
   - In the large bowl with the massaged kale, add roasted sweet potatoes, pomegranate seeds, and roasted pepitas.
   - Drizzle the salad with the tahini dressing and toss to combine.

5. **Serve**
   - Transfer the salad to a serving platter or individual bowls.
   - Garnish with additional pomegranate seeds or pepitas if desired.
   - Serve immediately with a chilled glass of Rosé Domaine Tempier Bandol 2020 to complement the flavors.

Enjoy this vibrant and flavorful salad that balances the earthiness of kale with sweet roasted potatoes and a luscious tahini dressing, pop of pomegranate seeds adding a refreshing tartness.
