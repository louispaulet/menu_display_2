### Seared Foie Gras with Poached Pear and Brioche Toast

#### Ingredients:
- **Foie Gras:**
  - 4 slices of fresh foie gras, approximately 2 oz each
  - Salt and freshly ground black pepper 

- **Poached Pears:**
  - 2 ripe but firm pears, peeled, cored, and halved
  - 2 cups dry white wine
  - 1 cup water
  - 1/2 cup granulated sugar
  - 1 cinnamon stick
  - 1 star anise

- **Brioche Toast:**
  - 4 slices brioche bread
  - 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

- **Garnish and Sauce:**
  - 2 tablespoons balsamic reduction
  - Fresh microgreens (such as watercress or arugula)

#### Instructions:

1. **Poaching the Pears:**

   - In a medium saucepan, combine the wine, water, sugar, cinnamon stick, and star anise. Stir until the sugar has dissolved.
   - Add the pear halves to the saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Cover and poach for 15-20 minutes until the pears are tender but not mushy.
   - Remove the pears from the liquid and set aside to cool. Strain the poaching liquid and reserve for another use if desired.

2. **Preparing the Brioche Toast:**

   - Preheat a large skillet over medium heat. Lightly butter each side of the brioche slices.
   - Toast the bread slices in the skillet until golden brown on both sides. Remove from heat and set aside.

3. **Cooking the Foie Gras:**

   - Score the foie gras on one side with a sharp knife, creating a shallow crosshatch pattern.
   - Season both sides with salt and pepper.
   - Heat a non-stick skillet over high heat until very hot. Add the foie gras slices and sear for approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute on each side until golden brown and caramelized. Foie gras should be seared outside but remain soft inside.
   - Remove foie gras from the skillet and let it rest briefly on a paper towel to absorb excess fat.

4. **Assembly:**

   - Place a slice of toasted brioche on each serving plate.
   - Top each with a seared foie gras piece.
   - Arrange a poached pear half next to the foie gras.
   - Drizzle balsamic reduction around the plate and garnish with microgreens for a pop of color and freshness.

5. **Serving and Pairing:**

   - Serve immediately. Pair with a glass of **Billecart-Salmon Cuvée Nicolas François Billecart 2006** for an exquisite dining experience.

Enjoy your gourmet appetizer that beautifully balances the rich, buttery foie gras with the sweet elegance of poached pears and the delicate crunch of brioche toast.
