## Green Tea and Pistachio Crème Brûlée with Sesame Brittle

### Ingredients

#### For the Crème Brûlée:
- 1 ½ cups heavy cream
- 1 ½ cups whole milk
- 1 tablespoon matcha green tea powder
- 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped
- 5 large egg yolks
- ½ cup granulated sugar
- ¼ cup shelled pistachios, finely chopped
- Extra granulated sugar for caramelizing

#### For the Sesame Brittle:
- ½ cup granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 tablespoon light corn syrup
- ¼ cup sesame seeds
- A pinch of sea salt

### Instructions

#### For the Crème Brûlée:
1. **Prepare the Oven and Ramekins:**
   - Preheat your oven to 320°F (160°C).
   - Place six ramekins in a baking pan.

2. **Infuse the Cream:**
   - In a medium saucepan, combine heavy cream, whole milk, matcha powder, and the vanilla bean with its seeds.
   - Warm the mixture over medium heat until it begins to steam, but do not let it boil. Remove from heat and cover. Let it infuse for 15 minutes.

3. **Beat the Yolks:**
   - In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until pale and slightly thickened.

4. **Combine Mixtures:**
   - Slowly whisk a small amount of the warm cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture to temper. Gradually add the rest, whisking continuously.

5. **Divide into Ramekins:**
   - Strain the custard through a fine sieve into a large pouring jug to remove any lumps.
   - Evenly distribute the custard into the prepared ramekins.

6. **Bake the Crème Brûlée:**
   - Pour hot water into the baking pan, halfway up the sides of the ramekins, creating a bain-marie.
   - Carefully transfer to the oven and bake for about 40-45 minutes, until the centers are just set.
   - Remove from the oven and allow to cool, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

7. **Caramelize the Tops:**
   - Just before serving, sprinkle a thin, even layer of granulated sugar over each crème brûlée.
   - Use a kitchen blowtorch to caramelize the sugar until golden brown.

#### For the Sesame Brittle:
1. **Prepare the Brittle:**
   - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
   - In a small saucepan, combine sugar, water, and corn syrup.
   - Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, swirling the pan occasionally until the sugar dissolves.
   - Cook until the mixture becomes a deep amber color, about 5-7 minutes.

2. **Add the Sesame Seeds:**
   - Stir in the sesame seeds and a pinch of sea salt, then quickly pour out onto the prepared baking sheet.
   - Spread the mixture thinly with a spatula, working quickly as it sets rapidly.
   - Allow to cool completely before breaking into shards.

### To Serve
1. **Finish the Dish:**
   - Before serving, sprinkle the finely chopped pistachios over the caramelized sugar on the crème brûlée.
   - Arrange sesame brittle shards decoratively on top.
2. **Pair with Wine:**
   - For a sophisticated finish, serve alongside a glass of Pedro Ximénez Toro Albala Don PX Gran Reserva 1987.

Enjoy your refined and elegantly flavored dessert, combining the earthy tones of matcha and pistachio with the sweet crunch of sesame brittle and the deep notes of a beautiful sherry!
