#### Instructions

**Artichoke Barigoule:**
1. **Prepare Artichokes:** Trim the artichokes by removing the outer leaves until you reach the tender ones. Cut off the top quarter and trim the stem. Rub the artichokes with lemon to prevent browning.
2. **Cook:** In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, and garlic, and saut√© until softened, about 5 minutes.
3. **Simmer:** Add wine, stock, and bay leaf to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Add the artichokes, cover, and simmer for 30-40 minutes until they are tender.
4. **Season:** Stir in lemon juice, season with salt and pepper, and remove from heat.

**Saffron Quinoa:**
1. **Rinse Quinoa:** Rinse quinoa under cold water to remove bitterness and set aside.
2. **Boil:** In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add quinoa and saffron threads.
3. **Simmer:** Reduce to a simmer, cover, and let cook for 15 minutes until the liquid is absorbed. Let it stand, covered, for 5 more minutes.
4. **Fluff and Season:** Fluff quinoa with a fork, add lemon zest and olive oil, and season with salt.

**Olive Tapenade:**
1. **Blend:** In a food processor, combine olives, garlic, capers, anchovy fillets, olive oil, and lemon juice.
2. **Process:** Blend until smooth, then season with black pepper to taste.

#### To Assemble
1. **Plate:** Place a serving of saffron quinoa on the plate.
2. **Add Artichoke:** Place an artichoke on top of the quinoa.
3. **Garnish:** Spoon a generous amount of olive tapenade over the artichokes.
