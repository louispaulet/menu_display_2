- **Parmigiano-Reggiano**
- **Taleggio**
- **Asiago**

### Fruit Compote:
- **2 cups mixed dried fruits** (apricots, figs, cherries)
- **1 cup water**
- **1/4 cup honey**
- **1 tablespoon lemon juice**
- **1 cinnamon stick**

### Artisanal Bread:
- **1 artisanal baguette**
- **Olive oil**, for brushing

### Balsamic Pearls:
- **100 ml balsamic vinegar**
- **1 teaspoon agar-agar powder**
- **1 cup cold vegetable or olive oil**

## Instructions

### Cheese Preparation:
1. Allow all cheeses to come to room temperature by removing from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before serving.
2. Arrange cheeses on a large platter, allowing each type its own space for presentation.

### Fruit Compote:
1. Chop dried fruits into small pieces.
2. In a medium saucepan, combine the dried fruits, water, honey, lemon juice, and cinnamon stick.
3. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat and simmer until the fruits soften and the liquid thickens into a syrupy consistency, about 15-20 minutes.
4. Remove the cinnamon stick and let the compote cool to room temperature before serving.

### Artisanal Bread:
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Slice the baguette into thin slices.
3. Brush each slice lightly with olive oil and place on a baking sheet.
4. Bake in the oven for about 8-10 minutes or until golden and crisp.

### Balsamic Pearls:
1. Pour the vegetable or olive oil into a glass and place it in the freezer for 30 minutes.
2. In a small saucepan, combine the balsamic vinegar and agar-agar powder. Stir until the agar-agar dissolves.
3. Bring to a boil and let it cool for a few minutes.
4. Using a dropper, gently drop the balsamic mixture into the cold oil. The drops will solidify upon contact to form pearls.
5. Using a fine-mesh strainer, drain the pearls from the oil and rinse with cold water.

### Assembling the Dish:
1. Place a small bowl of fruit compote in the center of a serving platter.
2. Arrange the sliced bread around the cheeses and place a bowl of balsamic pearls alongside.
3. Serve with a bottle of Tignanello Antinori 2017 to perfectly complement the flavors.

### Wine Pairing:
- **Tignanello Antinori 2017**, a well-structured red wine, enhances the nutty and creamy textures of the cheeses and pairs beautifully with the sweet and tangy compote for an elevated dining experience. Enjoy!
