## Lobster Bisque with Cognac and Saffron Cream

### Ingredients:

#### For the Bisque:
- 2 whole lobsters (1.5 lbs each, cooked)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter
- 2 medium shallots, chopped
- 1 stalk celery, chopped
- 1 small carrot, peeled and chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1/2 cup cognac or brandy
- 1 1/2 cups dry white wine
- 1 quart seafood stock or fish broth
- 1 sprig fresh thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup heavy cream

#### For the Saffron Cream:
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- A small pinch of saffron threads

### Garnish:
- Chopped fresh chives
- Lemon zest

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Lobster:** 
    - Remove and reserve the lobster meat from the shells, chopping it into bite-sized pieces. Keep the shells for stock preparation.

2. **Make the Stock:**
    - In a large pot, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat. Add lobster shells and sauté for about 5-7 minutes until aromatic and slightly browned.
    - Add shallots, celery, carrot, and garlic; cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.
    - Add tomato paste and stir well to coat the mixture.
    - Carefully add the cognac and let it simmer until reduced by half. Then add white wine and seafood stock.
    - Add thyme and bay leaf, season with salt and pepper, and bring to a boil.
    - Reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 30 minutes, occasionally skimming any foam that rises to the surface.

3. **Blend and Strain:**
    - Remove the thyme and bay leaf. Use an immersion blender to puree the mixture until smooth.
    - Strain the bisque through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into another pot, pressing the solids with the back of a spoon to extract all the liquid.

4. **Finish the Bisque:**
    - Return the bisque to low heat, stir in the heavy cream, and adjust the seasoning as needed. Let it gently simmer.

5. **Prepare the Saffron Cream:**
    - In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the cream and add the saffron threads. Allow it to steep until the cream takes on a vibrant orange hue, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.

6. **Serve:**
    - Ladle the bisque into warm bowls. Add the reserved lobster pieces to each serving.
    - Drizzle saffron cream over the top and garnish with chives and a touch of lemon zest.

### Wine Pairing:
Pair this luxurious dish with a glass of **Château d'Yquem Sauternes 2018**, whose complex and rich flavors beautifully complement the richness of the bisque.
