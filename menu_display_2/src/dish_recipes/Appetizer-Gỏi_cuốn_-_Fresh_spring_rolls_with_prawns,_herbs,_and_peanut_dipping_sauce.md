## Gỏi cuốn - Fresh Spring Rolls with Prawns, Herbs, and Peanut Dipping Sauce

### Ingredients

#### For the Spring Rolls:
- 200g medium-sized prawns, peeled and deveined
- 50g rice vermicelli noodles
- 8 rice paper wrappers
- 1 small head of lettuce, leaves separated and washed
- 1 cucumber, julienned
- 1 carrot, julienned
- Fresh herbs (mint, Thai basil, and cilantro)
- 50g bean sprouts

#### For the Peanut Dipping Sauce:
- 3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
- 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons lime juice
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon chili garlic sauce or sriracha (optional)
- 1/4 cup water to adjust consistency
- Crushed peanuts and chopped cilantro for garnish

### Instructions

#### Preparing the Filling:
1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the prawns until pink and opaque (about 3 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process.
2. Use the same boiling water to cook the rice vermicelli noodles as per package instructions, usually about 3-4 minutes. Drain and cool under cold running water.

#### Making the Peanut Dipping Sauce:
1. In a small bowl, whisk together peanut butter, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, minced garlic, and chili sauce (if using).
2. Gradually add water until you reach your desired dipping sauce consistency, usually around 1/4 cup. Adjust the seasoning as needed.
3. Garnish with crushed peanuts and chopped cilantro.

#### Assembling the Spring Rolls:
1. Fill a shallow dish with lukewarm water. Dip a rice paper wrapper into the water, rotating for about 5 seconds until it becomes soft and pliable.
2. Place the softened wrapper on a clean, damp kitchen towel or cutting board.
3. On the lower third of the wrapper, place a piece of lettuce, followed by a small handful of rice noodles, a few prawns, cucumber, carrot, bean sprouts, and a mix of herbs.
4. Fold the bottom edge of the wrapper over the filling, fold the sides inward, and roll tightly upwards.
5. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 8 rolls.

### Serving Instructions
1. Arrange the spring rolls on a serving platter.
2. Serve immediately with the peanut dipping sauce on the side.

### Wine Pairing
- **Gewürztraminer Trimbach 2018**: The slightly sweet and aromatic characteristics of this wine beautifully complement the fresh herbs and the rich, nutty dipping sauce in the Gỏi cuốn. Its vibrant acidity balances the flavors and enhances your tasting experience.
