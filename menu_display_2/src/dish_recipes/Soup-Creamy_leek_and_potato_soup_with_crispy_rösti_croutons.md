# Creamy Leek and Potato Soup with Crispy Rösti Croutons

## Ingredients

### Soup
- 4 large leeks, white and light green parts only, sliced and thoroughly washed
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- 3 medium Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced
- 4 cups vegetable or chicken stock
- 1 cup heavy cream
- Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste
- Fresh chives, chopped, for garnish

### Rösti Croutons
- 2 medium potatoes, peeled
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

### For the Rösti Croutons:
1. Grate the potatoes using a box grater and squeeze out excess moisture using a kitchen towel.
2. Season the grated potatoes with salt and pepper.
3. In a skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
4. Form the grated potatoes into small patties, about the size of traditional croutons.
5. Fry the patties until golden and crispy, about 3-5 minutes on each side. Remove and drain on paper towels. Set aside.

### For the Soup:
1. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat.
2. Add the leeks and sauté gently until softened, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the diced potatoes and continue to cook for another 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Pour in the stock and bring the mixture to a boil.
5. Reduce the heat and let the soup simmer, uncovered, for about 20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.
6. Using an immersion blender, puree the soup until smooth. Alternatively, blend the soup in batches using a countertop blender. If using a blender, ensure to let steam escape to avoid splattering.
7. Stir in the heavy cream and season with salt and white pepper to taste.
8. Allow the soup to simmer gently for another 5-10 minutes to thicken and heat through.

### To Serve:
1. Ladle the soup into warmed bowls.
2. Place a few rösti croutons atop each serving.
3. Garnish with freshly chopped chives.

### Wine Pairing
- **Wine:** Sauvignon Blanc Domaine Jean-René Germanier 2020

Enjoy this comforting dish with its rich creamy texture and a delightful crunch from the rösti croutons paired with a crisp Sauvignon Blanc for a perfectly balanced meal.
