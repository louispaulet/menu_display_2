## Ingredients

### For the Langoustines
- 12 Mediterranean langoustines, cleaned and deveined
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

### For the Saffron Risotto
- 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
- 4 cups chicken or vegetable stock, kept warm
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### For the Lobster Bisque Reduction
- 1/2 cup high-quality lobster bisque
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon fresh tarragon, chopped

## Instructions

### Preparing the Langoustines
1. **Marinate the Langoustines**: In a large bowl, combine olive oil, lemon zest, sea salt, black pepper, and parsley. Add the langoustines and toss to coat. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

2. **Grill the Langoustines**: Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Grill langoustines for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until they are just cooked through and have grill marks. Set aside.

### Cooking the Saffron Risotto
1. **Infuse the Saffron**: Add the saffron threads to the warm stock to infuse while preparing the other components.

2. **Sauté Aromatics**: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add onions and garlic; sauté until translucent and fragrant, about 3 minutes.

3. **Cook the Rice**: Add Arborio rice to the skillet, stirring to coat the grains with butter and aromatics, cooking for 1-2 minutes until slightly toasted.

4. **Deglaze and Simmer**: Pour in the white wine, stirring constantly, until completely absorbed by the rice. Gradually add the saffron-infused stock, one ladle at a time, stirring frequently and only adding more once the previous batch is absorbed. Continue this process until the rice is tender yet al dente, about 18 minutes.

5. **Finish with Cheese**: Stir in Parmesan cheese, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm.

### Making the Lobster Bisque Reduction
1. **Simmer the Bisque**: In a small saucepan, bring the lobster bisque to a low simmer over medium heat. Stir often and reduce by half.

2. **Add the Cream and Butter**: Stir in heavy cream and butter, whisking constantly until the reduction is smooth and glossy.

3. **Finish with Tarragon**: Stir in fresh tarragon and remove from heat.

### Plating the Dish
1. **Serve the Risotto**: Spoon saffron risotto evenly onto serving plates.

2. **Arrange Langoustines**: Place grilled langoustines atop the risotto.

3. **Drizzle with Bisque Reduction**: Drizzle lobster bisque reduction artfully around the langoustines and risotto. Garnish with fresh parsley or tarragon if desired.

4. **Optional Wine Pairing**: Pour a glass of Sassicaia Tenuta San Guido 2018 and serve immediately.
