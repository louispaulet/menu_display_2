## Instructions

### Preparing the Braised Venison
1. **Preheat oven to 325°F (165°C).**
2. **Season the venison** with salt and pepper. In a heavy braising pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat.
3. **Brown the venison** on all sides, then remove it from the pan and set aside.
4. **In the same pan, add carrots, onion, and garlic,** sauté until the onion becomes translucent.
5. **Add tomato paste** and cook for another minute, stirring constantly.
6. **Pour in the red wine** and bring it to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
7. **Return the venison** to the pan and add beef stock, thyme, bay leaf, and juniper berries. Bring to a simmer.
8. **Cover the pot** and transfer to the preheated oven. Braise for 2-3 hours until the venison is tender.

### Preparing the Spätzle
1. **In a large bowl, combine flour and salt.** Create a well in the middle and add eggs and milk.
2. **Beat the mixture** until smooth and bubbly.
3. **Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.**
4. **Using a spätzle maker or a colander with large holes,** press the dough through into the boiling water.
5. **Cook until they float** to the top, then remove with a slotted spoon.
6. **Melt butter in a frying pan** and toss the cooked spätzle to coat. Season with salt.

### Preparing the Braised Red Cabbage
1. **In a large sauté pan, heat olive oil over medium heat.** Add the onion and cook until soft.
2. **Stir in cabbage and apple.** Sprinkle with brown sugar and allspice.
3. **Pour in red wine vinegar,** stir to coat the cabbage, and cover the pan.
4. **Simmer for 30 minutes,** stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
