# Selection of Russian Artisanal Cheeses with Lingonberry Jam and Rye Crackers Recipe

## Ingredients:

### Cheeses:
- **Tvorog**: Popular Russian farmer's cheese.
- **Syrnik**: A type of Russian cottage cheese.
- **Adyghe Cheese**: Soft cheese similar to feta.
- **Kostroma Cheese**: A rich, slightly sour cheese with a crumbly texture.
- **Ossetian Cheese**: Cheesy tang with a unique taste reminiscent of a mixture of feta and mozzarella.

### Jam:
- 1 cup fresh or frozen lingonberries
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice

### Crackers:
- 1 cup rye flour
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 6 tablespoons water (adjust as needed)

## Instructions:

### Preparation of Lingonberry Jam:
1. **Cook the Lingonberries**: In a medium saucepan, combine the lingonberries and sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the berries begin to release their juices and the sugar dissolves (about 5 minutes).
2. **Simmer**: Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for approximately 10-15 minutes until thickened, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
3. **Add Lemon Juice**: Stir in the lemon juice.
4. **Cool the Jam**: Remove from heat and allow to cool. Store in an airtight container if not using immediately.

### Preparation of Rye Crackers:
1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. **Make Dough**: In a mixing bowl, combine rye flour, all-purpose flour, and salt. Add olive oil and slowly incorporate water until the mixture forms a ball.
3. **Roll the Dough**: Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8 inch thick.
4. **Cut Crackers**: Using a knife or pizza cutter, slice into desired shapes.
5. **Bake**: Place onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes or until crisp and golden.
6. **Cool and Store**: Let the crackers cool on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container to keep fresh.

### Assembly:
1. **Cheese Platter Arrangement**: Arrange a selection of Tvorog, Syrnik, Adyghe, Kostroma, and Ossetian cheese on a large platter. Scale according to the number of servings desired.
2. **Add Jam**: Serve the homemade lingonberry jam in a small bowl or ramekin.
3. **Add Crackers**: Arrange the homemade rye crackers around the cheeses for easy pairing.

## Wine Pairing:
To complement the dish, serve with a glass of **Cahors Château du Cèdre 2017**, a robust red wine from the South of France that enhances the creamy textures and tartness of the cheese and jam pairing.
