## Beetroot-cured Salmon with Horseradish Cream and Microgreens

### Ingredients

#### For the Salmon Cure:
- 1 side of fresh salmon, skin-on (about 1.5 lbs)
- 1 medium beetroot, peeled and grated
- ½ cup coarse sea salt
- ½ cup granulated sugar
- Zest of 1 lemon
- Zest of 1 orange
- 1 tablespoon black peppercorns, crushed
- ¼ cup fresh dill, roughly chopped

#### For the Horseradish Cream:
- ½ cup crème fraîche
- 2 tablespoons fresh horseradish, finely grated
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- Salt and black pepper to taste

#### For Garnish:
- Microgreens (such as arugula, radish, or pea shoots)
- Edible flowers (optional)

### Instructions

#### Preparing the Salmon:
1. **Prepare the Cure:** In a mixing bowl, combine the grated beetroot, sea salt, sugar, lemon zest, orange zest, crushed peppercorns, and chopped dill.
2. **Apply to Salmon:** Place the salmon, skin-side down, on a large sheet of plastic wrap. Evenly pack and coat the flesh side of the salmon with the beetroot cure mixture.
3. **Wrap and Weigh Down:** Wrap the salmon tightly with plastic wrap, ensuring the cure is fully enclosed. Place it on a tray and set a weight on top (such as another tray with cans or a heavy pan) to press it down.
4. **Refrigerate and Cure:** Refrigerate the salmon for 24-48 hours. Check for firmness and color of the salmon after 24 hours and decide if additional curing is needed.

#### Making the Horseradish Cream:
1. **Blend Ingredients:** In a bowl, mix the crème fraîche, grated horseradish, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper until smooth.
2. **Chill:** Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.

#### Assembling the Dish:
1. **Slice the Salmon:** Once cured, remove the weight and unwrap the salmon. Rinse off the cure under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Using a sharp knife, thinly slice the salmon diagonally away from the skin.
2. **Plate:** Arrange the slices of salmon onto small serving plates or spoons as an amuse-bouche portion.
3. **Add Cream:** Dollop or pipe a small amount of horseradish cream next to or on top of each piece of salmon.
4. **Garnish:** Top with a few microgreens and edible flowers for color and freshness.
5. **Serve:** Enjoy with a glass of Domaine Zind-Humbrecht Riesling 2019 for a harmonious pairing.

### Notes
- Ensure the salmon is sushi-grade and fresh for the best flavor and safety.
- The beetroot imparts both flavor and a beautiful color to the salmon, making it visually appealing as part of a fine dining experience.
- Adjust the amount of horseradish in the cream to taste for more or less heat.
