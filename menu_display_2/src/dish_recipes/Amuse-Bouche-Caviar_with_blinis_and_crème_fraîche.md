### Caviar with Blinis and Crème Fraîche

#### Ingredients

For the Blinis:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 large eggs, separated
- 1 cup whole milk, warmed
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 1 tsp instant yeast
- 1 tbsp sugar
- Butter, for frying

For Serving:
- 2 oz high-quality caviar
- 1 cup crème fraîche
- Fresh chives, finely chopped, for garnish

#### Instructions

##### Making the Blinis:
1. **Prepare the Batter:**
   - In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks, warm milk, melted butter, yeast, and sugar until well combined.
   - Gradually add the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring until smooth.

2. **Allow to Rise:**
   - Cover the batter with a kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in volume.

3. **Beat Egg Whites:**
   - In a clean, dry bowl, whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg whites into the risen batter until just combined.

4. **Cook the Blinis:**
   - Heat a small amount of butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Drop tablespoon-sized amounts of batter onto the skillet, cooking the blinis in batches.
   - Cook for 1-2 minutes on each side until golden brown. Transfer to a plate lined with a paper towel to drain excess butter.

##### Assembling the Amuse-Bouche:
1. **Arrange the Blinis** on a serving platter.
2. **Add a Dollop of Crème Fraîche** atop each blini.
3. **Top with Caviar:**
   - Carefully place a small spoonful of caviar on top of the crème fraîche.

4. **Garnish:**
   - Sprinkle finely chopped fresh chives over each caviar-topped blini for a pop of color and freshness.

5. **Serve Immediately:**
   - Serve with Dom Pérignon Vintage 2010 for an exquisite pairing.

#### Notes
- Ensure that all ingredients are of the highest quality for the most refined taste experience.
- Blinis can be made a few hours in advance and reheated gently in a warm oven.
- Use a mother of pearl or wooden spoon to handle caviar to prevent altering its delicate taste.
