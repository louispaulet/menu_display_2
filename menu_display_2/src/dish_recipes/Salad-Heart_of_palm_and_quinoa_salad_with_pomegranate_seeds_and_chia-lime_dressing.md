### Heart of Palm and Quinoa Salad with Pomegranate Seeds and Chia-Lime Dressing

#### Ingredients

**For the Salad:**
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups water
- 200g heart of palm, sliced
- 1 cup pomegranate seeds
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 cucumber, diced
- 1/4 cup red onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 50g feta cheese, crumbled
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the Chia-Lime Dressing:**
- 1 1/2 tablespoons chia seeds
- 1 lime, zest and juice
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 1 tablespoon honey (or agave syrup for vegan option)
- 1 clove garlic, finely minced
- Salt and pepper to taste

#### Instructions

1. **Cook the Quinoa:**
   - Rinse the quinoa under cold water to remove its natural bitterness.
   - Combine the quinoa and water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover. Cook for 15 minutes or until all the water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy.
   - Remove from heat and let it cool.

2. **Prepare the Dressing:**
   - In a small bowl, combine chia seeds with lime juice and zest. Let them sit for about 10 minutes to allow the chia seeds to expand.
   - Whisk in olive oil, honey, minced garlic, salt, and pepper.
   - Adjust seasoning according to taste.

3. **Assemble the Salad:**
   - In a large salad bowl, combine the cooked quinoa with heart of palm, pomegranate seeds, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and chopped cilantro.
   - Pour the chia-lime dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.

4. **Serve:**
   - Transfer the salad to a serving dish and sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese on top.
   - Serve immediately or refrigerate for 30 minutes to let the flavors meld.

#### Wine Pairing
- **Sauvignon Blanc Cloudy Bay Te Koko 2017**: This wine's vibrant acidity and citrus notes will perfectly complement the refreshing flavors of the heart of palm and pomegranate, enhancing the overall dining experience.

#### Tips
- For extra flavor, lightly toast the quinoa before boiling, which adds a nutty aroma.
- If fresh pomegranate isn't available, you can use dried pomegranate seeds, soaked in water for a few hours before use.
- To make this salad vegan, simply omit the feta cheese or replace it with a vegan cheese alternative.
