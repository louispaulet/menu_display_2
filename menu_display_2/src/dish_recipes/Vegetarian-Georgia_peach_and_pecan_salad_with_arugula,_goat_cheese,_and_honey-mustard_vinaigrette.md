## Georgia Peach and Pecan Salad with Arugula, Goat Cheese, and Honey-Mustard Vinaigrette

### Ingredients

#### For the Salad:
- 2 cups fresh arugula, washed and dried 
- 2 ripe Georgia peaches, sliced
- 1/3 cup pecans, toasted
- 1/4 cup goat cheese, crumbled
- Optional: a few fresh mint leaves, for garnish

#### For the Honey-Mustard Vinaigrette:
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Pecans:**  
   - Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Spread the pecans on a baking sheet in a single layer. Toast in the oven for about 5-7 minutes, stirring once, until they are fragrant and lightly browned. Remove from the oven and let them cool.

2. **Make the Vinaigrette:**  
   - In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, apple cider vinegar, honey, and Dijon mustard until well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the sweetness or acidity to your liking by adding more honey or vinegar if needed.

3. **Assemble the Salad:**  
   - On a large serving platter or in individual bowls, arrange a bed of arugula. 
   - Top with sliced peaches.
   - Sprinkle the toasted pecans and crumbled goat cheese evenly over the salad.
   - Garnish with a few fresh mint leaves if desired.

4. **Dress the Salad:**  
   - Drizzle the honey-mustard vinaigrette over the salad just before serving. Toss gently to coat the salad with the dressing.

5. **Serve:**  
   - Serve this vibrant salad immediately while the peaches are fresh and juicy.
   
### Wine Pairing
- **Riesling Chateau Ste. Michelle Eroica 2019**: The crisp, slightly sweet notes of this Riesling beautifully complement the juicy peaches and the tangy goat cheese, while its vibrant acidity balances the richness of pecans.

This delightful salad combines the fresh flavors of Georgia's ripe peaches with the earthy crunch of pecans, enhanced by the peppery arugula and creamy goat cheese. The honey-mustard vinaigrette ties everything together making this salad a refreshing and elegant starter or side for any meal. Enjoy!
