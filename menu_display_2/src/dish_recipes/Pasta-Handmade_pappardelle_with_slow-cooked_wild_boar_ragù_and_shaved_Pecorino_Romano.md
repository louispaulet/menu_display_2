#### For the Wild Boar Ragù:
- 500g (1 lb) wild boar shoulder or leg, cut into 2cm cubes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
- 1 carrot, diced
- 1 celery stalk, diced
- 1 sprig fresh rosemary
- 2 bay leaves
- 200ml (3/4 cup + 2 tbsp) red wine, preferably a Tuscan variety
- 500g (2 cups) passata or peeled and chopped tomatoes

- Salt and pepper to taste

#### For Serving:

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Make the Pappardelle
1. **Prepare the Dough:** On a clean countertop, pour the flour into a mound and create a well in the center. Crack the eggs into the well, add a pinch of salt, and slowly incorporate the flour into the eggs using a fork.
2. **Knead the Dough:** Once combined, knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap in cling film and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.
3. **Roll out the Dough:** After resting, divide the dough into two pieces. Roll each piece out into a thin sheet with a rolling pin or pasta machine, about 1-2mm thick.
4. **Cut the Pappardelle:** Dust the sheets with semolina flour, fold them onto each other, and cut into 1-inch wide strips. Unfold and lay flat on a dusted surface.

#### Step 2: Prepare the Wild Boar Ragù
1. **Brown the Meat:** In a large, heavy-based saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the wild boar chunks and brown on all sides. Remove from the pan and set aside.
2. **Sauté the Vegetables:** In the same saucepan, add the chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Sauté until the vegetables are soft and the onion is translucent.
3. **Simmer the Ragù:** Return the browned boar to the pan. Add the rosemary, bay leaves, and red wine. Simmer until the wine has reduced by half.
4. **Add Tomatoes and Stock:** Stir in the passata and stock. Lower the heat and let the ragù simmer gently for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender and the sauce thickened. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

#### Step 3: Cook and Assemble
1. **Cook the Pappardelle:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pappardelle for about 3-4 minutes until al dente. Drain, reserving a little pasta cooking water.
2. **Toss and Serve:** Gently toss the cooked pappardelle with the wild boar ragù, adding a bit of the reserved pasta water if necessary to achieve desired sauce consistency.
3. **Finish:** Serve immediately, topped with freshly shaved Pecorino Romano and a sprinkle of fresh parsley if desired.

### Wine Pairing
Complement this rich dish with a glass of Brunello di Montalcino Biondi Santi Riserva 2013, which pairs beautifully with the hearty flavors of the ragù and the pappardelle's texture.
