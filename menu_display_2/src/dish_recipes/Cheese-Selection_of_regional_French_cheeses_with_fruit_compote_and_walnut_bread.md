## Selection of Regional French Cheeses with Fruit Compote and Walnut Bread

### Cheese Selection

Select a variety of regional French cheeses to provide a harmonious balance in flavor, texture, and aroma. Aim for three to five different cheeses for variety:

1. **Camembert** - A creamy, smooth, and strong-flavored cheese from Normandy.
2. **Comté** - A hard cheese with a nutty, sweet flavor from the Franche-Comté region.
3. **Roquefort** - A blue cheese with tangy, intense flavors and a crumbly, creamy texture, originating from the Midi-Pyrénées.
4. **Chèvre** - A soft, fresh goat cheese, light and slightly tangy, from the Loire Valley.
5. **Reblochon** - A semi-soft cheese with a washed rind, full, nutty, and mild, from the Savoie region.

### Fruit Compote

This compote complements the richness of the cheeses with sweet and tangy flavors.

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup dried figs, chopped
- 1 cup dried apricots, chopped
- 1/2 cup dried cranberries
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/4 cup fresh orange juice
- Zest of 1 orange
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg

#### Instructions:
1. In a saucepan, combine the dried fruits, water, honey, orange juice, orange zest, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
2. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the fruits are plump and the mixture thickens.
3. Remove from heat and let the compote cool to room temperature. This can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator.

### Walnut Bread

This rustic walnut bread provides a hearty base with a slight crunch.

#### Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 1/4 cups buttermilk
- 1/3 cup honey
- 1 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped

#### Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a loaf pan.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. In another bowl, blend the buttermilk and honey.
4. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the wet mixture. Stir gently until just combined, then fold in the walnuts.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top.
6. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
7. Let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
