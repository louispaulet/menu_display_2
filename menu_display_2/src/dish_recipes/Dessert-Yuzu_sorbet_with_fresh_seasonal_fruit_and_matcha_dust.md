## Yuzu Sorbet with Fresh Seasonal Fruit and Matcha Dust

### Ingredients

#### Yuzu Sorbet
- **1 cup** yuzu juice (freshly squeezed or store-bought)
- **1 cup** water
- **3/4 cup** sugar
- **1 tablespoon** yuzu zest
- **1 tablespoon** light corn syrup

#### Fresh Seasonal Fruit
- **1/2 cup** strawberries, hulled and sliced
- **1/2 cup** blueberries
- **1/2 cup** sliced kiwi

#### Matcha Dust
- **1 tablespoon** culinary grade matcha powder

### Instructions

#### For the Yuzu Sorbet
1. **Prepare the Sorbet Base:**
   - In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine water and sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves completely and the mixture becomes clear (approximately 5 minutes).
   - Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.
   - Once cool, stir in the yuzu juice, yuzu zest, and corn syrup. Mix well.

2. **Chill and Freeze:**
   - Transfer the yuzu mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually about 20-25 minutes, until it has thickened.
   - Transfer the churned sorbet into an airtight container and freeze for at least 2 hours, or until firm.
   
#### For the Fresh Seasonal Fruit
3. **Prepare the Fruit:**
   - Wash and prepare the fruit as needed. Combine all the fruit in a bowl and gently mix them together.

#### For the Matcha Dust
4. **Prepare Matcha Dust:**
   - Place the matcha powder into a fine mesh strainer or sifter and gently tap to create a fine "dust."

### Assembly
5. **Plating the Dessert**
   - On a dessert plate or in a shallow bowl, place a generous scoop of yuzu sorbet in the center.
   - Arrange the prepared fresh fruits around the sorbet.
   - Using the strained matcha powder, gently dust over the sorbet and fruit for a finishing touch.

### Wine Pairing
- Serve with Hakushika Hanaomoi Junmai Ginjo to complement the zesty citrus notes of the dessert.

### Notes
- **Substitute:** If yuzu is unavailable, you can substitute with a mixture of 3 parts lemon juice and 1 part lime juice for a similar flavor profile.
- **Storage:** The sorbet can be kept in the freezer for up to a week, though it is best enjoyed fresh for maximum flavor and texture.
