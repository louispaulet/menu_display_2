#### Ingredients

**For the Turbot:**
- 4 fillets of turbot, skin-on and scaled
- Sea salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp butter

**For the Fennel Confit:**
- 2 medium fennel bulbs, sliced thinly
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1 cup low-sodium chicken or vegetable stock
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tsp fennel seeds
- Zest of 1 lemon
- Salt and pepper, to taste

**For the Saffron-Orange Emulsion:**
- 1 pinch saffron threads
- 1/2 cup fresh orange juice
- 1/2 cup fish or vegetable stock
- 1 small shallot, minced
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, cold and diced
- Salt, to taste

**For Garnish:**
- 1/2 cup Kalamata or Ni√ßoise olives, pitted and halved
- Fresh fennel fronds
- Fresh parsley, chopped

#### Instructions

**Prepare the Fennel Confit:**
1. Heat olive oil in a medium-sized pan over medium heat. Add the fennel, bay leaf, and fennel seeds. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Cook gently, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes until the fennel starts to soften.
3. Add the chicken stock and lemon zest. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let simmer for 20-25 minutes until the fennel is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Keep warm.

**Prepare the Saffron-Orange Emulsion:**
1. In a small saucepan, combine saffron threads and orange juice. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, allowing the saffron to infuse the liquid for about 5 minutes.
2. Add the stock and shallots, and continue to simmer until reduced by half.
3. Gradually whisk in the cold butter one piece at a time, ensuring each piece is melted before adding the next. Season with salt to taste and keep warm, but do not boil further.

**Cook the Turbot:**
1. Pat the turbot fillets dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper on both sides.
2. Heat olive oil in a large non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and allow it to foam.
3. Place the turbot fillets in the pan, skin side down. Press gently with a spatula to keep the skin flat against the pan.
4. Cook for about 3-4 minutes until the skin is crispy and golden brown. Carefully flip the fillets and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the fish is opaque and cooked through.

**Assemble the Dish:**
1. Divide the fennel confit among four plates, creating a bed for the fish.
2. Lay a turbot fillet, skin side up, over the fennel.
3. Drizzle the saffron-orange emulsion around the fish and over the fennel.
4. Garnish with olives, fresh fennel fronds, and parsley.
5. Serve immediately with a chilled glass of Planeta Chardonnay 2019.
