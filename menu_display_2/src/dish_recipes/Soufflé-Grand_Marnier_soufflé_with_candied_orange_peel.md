## Grand Marnier Soufflé with Candied Orange Peel

### Ingredients

#### For the Soufflé:
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing
- Granulated sugar for dusting
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 1/4 cups whole milk
- Pinch of salt
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1/4 cup Grand Marnier
- 6 large eggs, separated

#### For the Candied Orange Peel:
- 2 large oranges
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup granulated sugar

### Preparation Steps

#### For the Candied Orange Peel:
1. **Prepare the Orange Peel:** Peel the oranges, removing as much of the white pith as possible. Slice the peels into thin strips.
2. **Blanch the Peels:** Place the orange peel in a pot of boiling water for 5 minutes to remove bitterness. Drain and repeat once more if necessary.
3. **Candy the Peels:** Combine sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Add the blanched peel and simmer gently for 30 minutes until translucent. Remove from syrup and let cool on a wire rack lined with parchment paper.

#### For the Soufflé:
1. **Prepare the Soufflé Dishes:** Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease the soufflé dishes with butter and dust with granulated sugar, ensuring the coating extends over the rim to help the soufflé rise. Place the dishes in the refrigerator to chill.
2. **Make the Béchamel Base:** In a medium saucepan, melt 5 tablespoons of butter. Stir in the flour to form a roux and cook for 2 minutes. Whisk in the milk gradually, ensuring no lumps. Add a pinch of salt and cook until thickened. Remove from heat, whisk in 1/3 cup sugar, vanilla, cornstarch, and Grand Marnier.
3. **Prep Egg Yolks and Whites:** Separate the egg yolks from whites. Whisk the yolks into the cooled milk mixture until smooth.
4. **Whip Egg Whites:** In a separate clean bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form, adding a pinch more granulated sugar to help stabilize.
5. **Fold Ingredients:** Gently fold the egg whites into the béchamel and yolk mixture, one-third at a time, until just combined (do not over-mix).
6. **Fill the Dishes:** Spoon the mixture into the prepared soufflé dishes, filling to just below the rim.
7. **Bake:** Place the dishes on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes until well-risen and slightly golden.

### To Serve
- **Present Immediately:** Serve the soufflés straight from the oven, as they will begin to deflate after a few minutes.
- **Top with Candied Orange Peel:** Decorate each soufflé with a few pieces of candied orange peel for added flavor and texture.

### Wine Pairing
- **Domaine Disznókő Tokaji Aszú 5 Puttonyos 2015:** The sweetness and citrus notes of this wine complement the Grand Marnier and candied orange peel beautifully, enhancing the overall experience of the dish.
