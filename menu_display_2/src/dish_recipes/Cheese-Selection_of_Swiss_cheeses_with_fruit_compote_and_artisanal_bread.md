## Instructions

### Prepare the Fruit Compote
1. Combine the dried figs, apricots, and cherries in a medium saucepan.
2. Add water, sugar, cinnamon stick, star anise, and lemon juice.
3. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat.
4. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the fruit is tender, and the liquid has reduced to a syrupy consistency.
5. Remove the cinnamon stick and star anise. Allow the compote to cool to room temperature.

### Assemble the Cheese Plate
1. Arrange slices of Emmental, Gruyère, and L’Etivaz on a cheese board.
2. Use a cheese curler or knife to shave Tête de Moine into delicate rosettes.
3. Place the fruit compote in a small bowl alongside the cheeses.
4. Arrange slices of artisanal bread on the board, or serve in a basket.

### Serving
- Serve at room temperature to allow the flavors of the cheeses to fully develop.
- Pair with a glass of **Humagne Rouge Domaine de Beudon 2018** wine to complement the cheese selection.

Enjoy your refined cheese course, balancing the richness of Swiss cheeses with the sweet-tart notes of fruit compote and the rustic charm of artisanal bread!
