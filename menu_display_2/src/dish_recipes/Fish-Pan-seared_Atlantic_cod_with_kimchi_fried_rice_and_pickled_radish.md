- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Juice of 1/2 lemon

**For the Kimchi Fried Rice:**
- 2 cups cooked jasmine or long-grain rice, cooled
- 1 cup kimchi, chopped, with its juice
- 1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean chili paste)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1-inch ginger piece, grated
- 1/2 cup scallions, chopped

**For the Pickled Radish:**
- 6-8 radishes, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup rice vinegar
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce

##### Instructions:

**1. Prepare the Pickled Radish:**
   1. In a small bowl, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and soy sauce. Stir until the sugar and salt dissolve.
   2. Add the sliced radishes, submerging them in the mixture. Allow them to pickle in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

**2. Cook the Kimchi Fried Rice:**
   1. Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
   2. Add the garlic and ginger, saut√© for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
   3. Stir in the chopped kimchi and gochujang. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the kimchi is caramelized.
   4. Add the rice, breaking up any clumps with a spatula, and stir to combine.
   5. Pour the soy sauce over the rice, mixing thoroughly. Season with salt to taste.
   6. Push the rice to one side of the skillet, add the beaten eggs on the other side, and scramble them until just cooked. Mix with the rice.
   7. Fold in the scallions and keep warm over low heat.

**3. Pan-Sear the Cod:**
   1. Pat the cod fillets dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
   2. In a large non-stick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.
   3. Add the cod fillets presentation side down (the flat side). Cook for about 3-4 minutes until golden and crispy.
   4. Carefully flip the fillets and add the butter to the pan. Cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, basting the fillets with the melted butter until the fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.
   5. Squeeze lemon juice over the fillets during the last minute of cooking.

**4. Serve:**
   1. Divide the kimchi fried rice among four plates.
   2. Place a cod fillet on top of each rice mound.
   3. Garnish with the pickled radishes.
   4. Serve immediately, paired with a glass of 2017 Chardonnay from Kistler Vine Hill Vineyard. Enjoy your meal!
