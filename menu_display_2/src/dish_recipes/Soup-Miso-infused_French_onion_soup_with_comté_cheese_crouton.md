## Ingredients

### For the Soup
- 4 large yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 6 cups beef stock
- 2 tablespoons white miso paste
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 bay leaf

### For the Comté Crouton
- 1 baguette, sliced into ½ inch rounds
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 200g Comté cheese, grated
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

## Instructions

### Preparing the Soup

1. **Caramelize the onions:**
   - In a large heavy-bottomed pot, melt the butter with olive oil over medium-high heat.
   - Add the onions, garlic, brown sugar, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 30-40 minutes, until the onions are deeply caramelized and golden brown. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent burning.

2. **Deglaze the pot:**
   - Pour in the white wine and scrape the brown bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon.
   - Cook until the wine reduces by half.

3. **Simmer the soup:**
   - Stir in the beef stock, miso paste, black pepper, bay leaf, and thyme sprigs.
   - Bring to a gentle boil, then lower the heat and let simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally.

4. **Season and finish:**
   - Remove the bay leaf and thyme sprigs. Taste and adjust for salt and pepper if necessary.

### Preparing the Comté Crouton

1. **Prepare the baguette slices:**
   - Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
   - Place the baguette slices on a baking sheet. Brush both sides lightly with olive oil.
   - Toast in the oven for 8–10 minutes, turning once, until both sides are golden.

2. **Add the cheese and mustard:**
   - Spread a thin layer of Dijon mustard on each toasted slice.
   - Top each slice with a generous amount of grated Comté cheese.

3. **Melt the cheese:**
   - Return the slices to the oven for 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

### Serving

1. **Assemble and serve:**
   - Ladle the hot soup into bowls.
   - Float one or two Comté croutons on top of each serving.
   - Optional: Garnish with fresh thyme leaves.

2. **Wine Pairing:**
   - Serve with a glass of Pinot Gris Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2019 to complement the soup's deep flavors.

Enjoy this sophisticated twist on the classic French onion soup, where savory miso enriches the broth while the Comté cheese crouton offers a deliciously melty topping.
