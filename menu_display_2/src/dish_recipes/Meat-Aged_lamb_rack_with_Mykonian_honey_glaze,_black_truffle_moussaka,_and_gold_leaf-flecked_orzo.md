   - Brush the lamb racks generously with the glaze and let them sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.
   - Heat a large ovenproof skillet over high heat and sear the lamb racks on both sides until browned.
   - Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes for medium-rare or preferred doneness.
   - Remove from the oven and let the meat rest for 10 minutes before slicing.

2. **Make the Black Truffle Moussaka:**
