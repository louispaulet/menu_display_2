### Ingredients

**Filo-Wrapped Kalamata Olives:**
- 12 large Kalamata olives, pitted
- 6 sheets of filo pastry, cut into 4-inch squares
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 12 small gold leaf sheets
- Sea salt, to taste

**Ouzo-Infused Tomato Jam:**
- 1 cup ripe tomatoes, cored and finely chopped
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons ouzo
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Ouzo-Infused Tomato Jam
1. **Prepare the Jam**: In a medium saucepan, combine the chopped tomatoes, sugar, and olive oil over medium-high heat.
2. **Simmer**: Stir in the ouzo, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the mixture thickens into a jam-like consistency, about 20-30 minutes.
3. **Season**: Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely before serving.

#### Filo-Wrapped Kalamata Olives
1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. **Wrap the Olives**: Brush each filo square lightly with melted butter. Place a pitted Kalamata olive in the center of each filo square. Gently wrap the filo around the olive, twisting at the top to secure.
3. **Bake**: Place the wrapped olives on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown and crisp.
4. **Finish with Gold Leaf**: Once cool enough to handle, carefully apply a small sheet of gold leaf onto each filo-wrapped olive using tweezers. Lightly brush additional melted butter on top to help adhere the gold leaf.

#### Assembly
1. **Plating**: Spread a teaspoon of the ouzo-infused tomato jam in the center of each serving spoon or plate.
2. **Place Olives**: Set one filo-wrapped gold-leafed olive onto each spoon or plate atop the tomato jam.
3. **Finish and Serve**: Garnish with a small pinch of sea salt if desired and serve immediately.

### Notes
- The key to this dish is balance; ensure the filo is crisp and light while the tomato jam is rich and slightly sweet with a hint of ouzo.
- For best results, prepare the tomato jam a day in advance to fully develop its flavors.

### Wine Pairing
Pair this delicate and flavorful amuse-bouche with Taittinger Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs 2010, which complements the dish beautifully with its crisp acidity and notes of citrus and white flowers.
