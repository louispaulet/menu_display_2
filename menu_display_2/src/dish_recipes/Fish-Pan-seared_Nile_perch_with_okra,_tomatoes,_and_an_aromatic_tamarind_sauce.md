# Pan-seared Nile Perch with Okra, Tomatoes, and Aromatic Tamarind Sauce

## Ingredients

### For the Fish
- 4 Nile perch fillets (around 200g each)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter

### For the Tamarind Sauce
- 2 tablespoons tamarind paste
- 1 cup fish or vegetable stock
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 red chili, finely chopped (optional)
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

### For the Vegetables
- 200g fresh okra, trimmed and halved
- 2 large tomatoes, chopped
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

### Prepare the Sauce
1. **Sauté Aromatics:** In a small saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, ginger, and red chili. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 4-5 minutes.

2. **Make the Sauce:** Stir in the tamarind paste, fish or vegetable stock, soy sauce, and honey. Bring to a simmer and let it reduce slightly until it thickens. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, turn off the heat, and set aside.

### Cook the Vegetables
1. **Sauté Okra and Tomatoes:** In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the okra and tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper.
   
2. **Cook Vegetables:** Sauté for about 7-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the okra is tender and the tomatoes start to break down. Keep warm.

### Cook the Fish
1. **Season the Fish:** Pat the perch fillets dry with a paper towel. Season both sides with salt and pepper.

2. **Sear the Fish:** In a large non-stick skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the butter, allowing it to melt and foam slightly.

3. **Cook:** Place the perch fillets into the skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until golden brown and cooked through. The fish should easily flake with a fork.

### To Serve
1. **Plate Up:** Place a bed of sautéed okra and tomatoes on each plate.

2. **Add Fish:** Lay the pan-seared perch on top of the vegetables.

3. **Finish with Sauce:** Drizzle the aromatic tamarind sauce over the fish and vegetables.

4. **Pairing Suggestion:** Serve immediately with a chilled glass of Cederberg Sauvignon Blanc 2020 for a delightful complementary pairing.
