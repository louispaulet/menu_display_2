### For the Tamarillo Sauce:

- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Garnish & Extras:

## Instructions:

### Prepare the Cured Patagonian Toothfish:
1. **Cure the Fish:** Combine the sea salt, sugar, lemon zest, lime zest, and cracked black pepper in a bowl. Rub this mixture all over the Patagonian toothfish fillets. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight for deeper flavor penetration.
2. **Rinse and Dry:** After curing, rinse the fillets under cold water to remove excess seasoning. Pat the fish dry with paper towels.

### Make the Chile-Infused Tapioca Pearls:
1. **Cook the Tapioca Pearls:** Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the tapioca pearls and cook for 15-20 minutes or until they become translucent, stirring occasionally. Drain and rinse under cold water.
2. **Infuse with Flavor:** In a frying pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced chile and minced garlic, sautéing until fragrant. Mix in the cooked tapioca pearls and sauté for an additional 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and set aside.

### Prepare the Tamarillo Sauce:
1. **Peel and Blanch:** Score the tops of the tamarillos and blanch them in boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove and place in an ice bath. Peel off the skins.
2. **Cook the Sauce:** In a saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat and sauté the chopped shallot until translucent. Add the peeled tamarillos, sugar, and white wine vinegar. Simmer gently until the tamarillos collapse and the sauce thickens. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Blend until smooth.

### Assembly:
1. **Plate the Fish:** Slice thin strips of the cured toothfish and arrange them artistically on each plate.
2. **Add Tapioca Pearls:** Spoon some chile-infused tapioca pearls around and on top of the fish slices.
3. **Drizzle Sauce:** Artfully drizzle the tamarillo sauce around the fish and tapioca pearls.
4. **Garnish:** Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves, microgreens, and a wedge of lemon or lime on the side.

### Wine Pairing:
- **Serving Suggestion:** Serve with a glass of **Chardonnay Catena Zapata Adrianna Vineyard White Bones 2018** to complement the flavors of the dish.
