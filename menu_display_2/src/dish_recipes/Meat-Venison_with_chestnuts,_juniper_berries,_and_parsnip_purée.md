## Ingredients

### Venison
- 800g venison loin, trimmed
- 2 tbsp vegetable or olive oil
- 2 tbsp butter
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 10 juniper berries, lightly crushed
- 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed

### Chestnut and Juniper Sauce
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 200ml beef stock
- 100ml red wine
- 10 cooked chestnuts, chopped
- 5 juniper berries, lightly crushed
- 1 tbsp honey
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Parsnip Purée
- 500g parsnips, peeled and roughly chopped
- 200ml heavy cream
- 50g unsalted butter
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

### Prepare the Parsnip Purée
1. **Boil Parsnips:** Place the chopped parsnips in a large saucepan, cover with salted water, and bring to a boil. Cook until tender, about 15-20 minutes.
2. **Blend:** Drain the parsnips and transfer them to a blender or food processor. Add the cream and butter, then blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm.

### Cook the Venison
1. **Season and Sear:** Rub the venison loin with salt, pepper, and crushed juniper berries. Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the meat on all sides until well-browned, about 2-3 minutes per side.
2. **Roast:** Add rosemary and crushed garlic to the skillet, then transfer the skillet to a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F). Roast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the meat and desired doneness.
3. **Rest:** Remove the venison from the oven and let it rest under foil for at least 5 minutes before slicing.

### Make the Chestnut and Juniper Sauce
1. **Sauté Shallots:** In the same skillet used for venison, add butter and sauté the shallot over medium heat until translucent.
2. **Deglaze:** Pour in the red wine and beef stock, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet for flavor.
3. **Simmer:** Add the juniper berries and chopped chestnuts to the sauce, and let it reduce slightly. Stir in honey, and season with salt and pepper.

### Assemble the Dish
1. **Slice the Venison:** Thinly slice the rested venison and arrange it on a large serving platter.
2. **Plate the Purée:** Spoon the parsnip purée alongside the venison.
3. **Drizzle Sauce:** Generously drizzle the chestnut and juniper sauce over the venison.

4. **Serve:** Garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs if desired and pair with a glass of Pomerol Château Gazin 2016 for an optimal dining experience.
