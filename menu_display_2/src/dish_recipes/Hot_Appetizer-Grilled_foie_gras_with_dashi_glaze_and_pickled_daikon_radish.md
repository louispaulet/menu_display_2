## Grilled Foie Gras with Dashi Glaze and Pickled Daikon Radish

### Ingredients:

#### For the Foie Gras:
- 4 slices of fresh foie gras (approximately 2 ounces each)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

#### For the Dashi Glaze:
- 1 cup dashi stock (can be made using dashi powder or homemade)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon mirin
- 1 tablespoon sake
- 1 teaspoon sugar

#### For the Pickled Daikon Radish:
- 1 cup daikon radish, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup rice vinegar
- 1/4 cup water
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt

#### Garnish:
- Microgreens or thinly sliced scallions (optional)

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Pickle the Daikon Radish
1. In a small saucepan, combine rice vinegar, water, sugar, and salt. Heat over medium until the sugar dissolves completely.
2. Let the mixture cool slightly, then pour over the sliced daikon radish in a small bowl.
3. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight for best results.

#### Step 2: Prepare the Dashi Glaze
1. In a small saucepan, combine dashi stock, soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar.
2. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over medium heat and let it reduce slightly for about 10 minutes or until it thickens into a glaze-like consistency.
3. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.

#### Step 3: Grill the Foie Gras
1. Season the foie gras slices on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
2. Heat a non-stick skillet or grill pan over high heat until hot.
3. Sear the foie gras slices for about 30 seconds to 1 minute on each side or until a rich golden-brown crust forms. Be careful to keep the center creamy.

#### Step 4: Assemble the Dish
1. Place each slice of grilled foie gras onto individual serving plates.
2. Drizzle the dashi glaze over the top of the foie gras slices.
3. Serve immediately with a small portion of pickled daikon radish on the side.
4. Garnish with microgreens or thinly sliced scallions if desired.

### Wine Pairing:
- **Chardonnay Joseph Drouhin Puligny-Montrachet 2018**: This balanced Chardonnay, with its crisp acidity and subtle oak, pairs elegantly with the richness of the foie gras and the umami of the dashi glaze.
