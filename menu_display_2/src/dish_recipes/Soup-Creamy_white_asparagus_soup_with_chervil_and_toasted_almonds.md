## Creamy White Asparagus Soup with Chervil and Toasted Almonds  

### Ingredients:

- 1 kg (2.2 lbs) white asparagus, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 liter (4 cups) chicken or vegetable stock
- 200 ml (3/4 cup) heavy cream
- Salt and white pepper, to taste
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted
- Fresh chervil leaves, for garnish

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Asparagus**: Start by peeling the white asparagus with a vegetable peeler, ensuring all the fibrous outer layer is removed. Cut off the woody ends, then chop the asparagus stalks into 2-inch pieces.

2. **Cook the Base**: In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes.

3. **Simmer the Soup**: Add the asparagus pieces to the pot and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour in the chicken or vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until the asparagus is tender, about 20 minutes.

4. **Blend Until Smooth**: Once the asparagus is cooked, use an immersion blender to purée the soup until smooth. Alternatively, you can transfer it in batches to a countertop blender. 

5. **Incorporate the Cream**: Return the puréed soup to the pot if using a countertop blender. Stir in the heavy cream and simmer for another 5 minutes until heated through. Season with salt, white pepper, and lemon juice to taste.

6. **Serve**: Ladle the creamy soup into bowls. Top each serving with a sprinkle of toasted almonds and a few fresh chervil leaves.

7. **Wine Pairing**: Serve with a chilled glass of Markus Molitor Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Riesling Spätlese 2018 to complement the delicate flavors of the soup.

### Tips:
- **Toasting Almonds**: For the toasted almonds, you can place them in a dry skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they are golden and fragrant.
- **Alternative Garnish**: If chervil isn’t available, fresh parsley or dill can be used as substitutes.

This luxurious soup, characterized by the subtle sweetness of white asparagus and the crunch of toasted almonds, offers a stunning interplay of textures and flavors perfect for spring or summer dining. Enjoy it as a starter or a light meal.
