#### Ingredients

- 80g Comté (French)
- 80g Brie de Meaux (French)
- 80g Roquefort (French)
- 80g Camembert de Normandie (French)
- 80g Sanuki Washed Rind (Japanese)
- 80g Sayamadori (Japanese)

**Fruit Compote**
- 200g mixed dried fruits (apricots, figs, and raisins)
- 100ml orange juice
- 1 tbsp honey
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon

**Rice Crackers**
- 200g rice crackers (assorted shapes and flavors)

#### Instructions

**1. Cheese Preparation:**
   
   a. Remove all cheeses from the refrigerator 1 hour before serving to allow them to reach room temperature, which enhances flavor and texture.
   
   b. Cut the cheeses into bite-sized portions. Arrange them on a large cheese board or platter. Place the cheeses in order of strength, starting from the mildest to the strongest.

**2. Fruit Compote:**

   a. Chop the dried fruits into small pieces. In a small saucepan, combine the dried fruits, orange juice, honey, lemon zest, vanilla extract, and cinnamon.
   
   b. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Lower the heat and let it simmer gently for 10-15 minutes until the fruits are soft and the liquid has thickened.

   c. Remove the compote from the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature.

**3. Serving Platters:**

   a. Place small bowls of the fruit compote around the cheese platter, ensuring there is enough for each type of cheese.

   b. Scatter the rice crackers around the cheeses, ensuring a balanced and attractive presentation.

**4. Wine Pairing**

   - Serve with a chilled bottle of **Chenin Blanc Domaine Huet Vouvray Le Mont Demi-Sec 2019**. The wine's hint of sweetness and vibrant acidity make it a perfect pairing with both the creamy and blue cheeses, while also complementing the sweetness of the fruit compote.

#### Tips

- **Arranging a cheese board**: Be deliberate with space to ensure that each cheese has its own 'zone' to prevent flavors from mixing on the board. Provide separate utensils for each cheese.

- **Compote Variations**: Adjust the fruits and spices in the compote to match seasonality or personal preference. Consider adding spices like ginger or cardamom for an aromatic twist.

- **Rice Crackers Selection**: Choose a variety of textures and flavors, such as sesame, seaweed, or soy sauce-flavored crackers, to add an additional layer of interest to the dish.
