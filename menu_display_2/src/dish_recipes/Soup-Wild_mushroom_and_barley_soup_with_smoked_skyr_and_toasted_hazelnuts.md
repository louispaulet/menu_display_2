## Wild Mushroom and Barley Soup with Smoked Skyr and Toasted Hazelnuts

### Ingredients

#### For the Soup
- 300g mixed wild mushrooms (such as chanterelles, porcini, and cremini)
- 100g pearl barley
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 liter vegetable or chicken stock
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

#### For the Smoked Skyr
- 200g Icelandic skyr
- 1 teaspoon liquid smoke
- Pinch of salt

#### For the Garnish
- 50g hazelnuts, toasted and roughly chopped
- Fresh parsley, finely chopped
- Extra virgin olive oil (optional)

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Mushrooms**: Clean the wild mushrooms with a damp cloth. If the mushrooms are large, slice them into smaller, bite-sized pieces.

2. **Cook the Barley**: Rinse the pearl barley under cold water. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, add the barley, and cook for about 20 minutes or until tender. Drain and set aside.

3. **Sauté the Vegetables**:
   - In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
   - Add the chopped onion and garlic, sauté until translucent and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
   - Stir in the wild mushrooms and continue to cook until they release their juices and start to brown, around 10 minutes.

4. **Simmer the Soup**:
   - Add the vegetable or chicken stock to the pot and bring to a simmer.
   - Stir in the cooked barley, soy sauce, and fresh thyme leaves.
   - Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Let the soup simmer gently for 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.

5. **Prepare the Smoked Skyr**:
   - In a small bowl, mix the skyr with the liquid smoke and a pinch of salt. Adjust the smoky flavor to your preference.

6. **Garnish and Serve**:
   - Ladle the soup into serving bowls.
   - Add a dollop of smoked skyr to each bowl.
   - Sprinkle with toasted hazelnuts and chopped parsley.
   - Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over the top if desired.
