## Ingredients:

**Rice Pudding**
- 1 cup Arborio rice
- 2 cups coconut milk
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 tsp ground cardamom
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt

**Mango Coulis**
- 2 ripe mangoes, peeled and cubed
- 1/4 cup water
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp lime juice

**Candied Pistachios**
- 1/2 cup shelled pistachios
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 2 tbsp water
- 1/4 tsp salt

## Instructions:

### Rice Pudding
1. **Rinse the Rice:** Rinse the Arborio rice under cold running water until the water runs clear.

2. **Cook the Rice:** In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the rinsed rice, coconut milk, whole milk, sugar, cardamom, and a pinch of salt. Stir well.

3. **Simmer:** Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally.

4. **Simmer and Thicken:** Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let simmer, stirring frequently, until the rice is tender and the mixture is creamy (about 25-30 minutes). Add the vanilla extract at the end.

5. **Adjust Consistency:** If necessary, add more milk to reach the desired consistency.

### Mango Coulis
1. **Blend the Mangoes:** In a blender, combine the mangoes, water, sugar, and lime juice. Blend until smooth.

2. **Strain:** Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any fibrous particles, ensuring a smooth coulis.

3. **Chill:** Refrigerate the coulis until ready to serve.

### Candied Pistachios
1. **Prepare a Baking Sheet:** Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

2. **Cook:** In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water and heat over medium heat until the sugar dissolves.

3. **Add the Pistachios:** Stir in the pistachios and cook while stirring frequently until the sugar syrup caramelizes and coats the pistachios (about 3-5 minutes).

4. **Spread and Cool:** Spread the candied pistachios on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with salt. Allow to cool completely.

### To Serve
1. **Plate the Pudding:** Spoon the coconut and cardamom rice pudding into individual serving bowls.

2. **Top with Coulis:** Drizzle the mango coulis over the rice pudding.

3. **Garnish with Pistachios:** Sprinkle generously with candied pistachios.

4. **Pair with Wine:** Serve alongside a glass of Sauternes Ch√¢teau Suduiraut 2017 for an exquisite pairing.

Enjoy this exotic and indulgent dessert that perfectly balances creamy, spicy, sweet, and nutty flavors.
