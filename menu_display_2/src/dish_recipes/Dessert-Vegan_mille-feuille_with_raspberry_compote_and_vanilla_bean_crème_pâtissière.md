# Vegan Mille-Feuille with Raspberry Compote and Vanilla Bean Crème Pâtissière

A refined dessert that's as delightful to look at as it is to taste. This vegan mille-feuille combines the elegance of layered puff pastry with the fresh burst of raspberry compote and the silken smoothness of vanilla bean crème pâtissière.

## Ingredients

### For the Puff Pastry
- 500g all-purpose flour
- 400g vegan butter (block form, very cold)
- 250ml ice-cold water
- 1 tsp salt

### For the Vanilla Bean Crème Pâtissière
- 500ml almond milk
- 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped
- 100g caster sugar
- 60g cornstarch
- 50g vegan butter
- Pinch of turmeric (optional, for color)

### For the Raspberry Compote
- 300g fresh or frozen raspberries
- 100g sugar
- Juice of 1/2 lemon

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Puff Pastry
1. **Mix the Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.
2. **Incorporate Butter**: Cut the cold vegan butter into small cubes. Rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. **Add Water**: Gradually add ice-cold water. Mix with a spatula until the dough comes together, being careful not to overwork.
4. **Form and Chill**: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
5. **Roll and Fold**: On a floured surface, roll the dough into a rectangle. Fold in thirds like a letter, turn 90 degrees, and roll out again. Repeat folding and rolling three times. Chill for another 30 minutes.

### Step 2: Make the Vanilla Bean Crème Pâtissière
1. **Infuse Milk**: In a saucepan, heat the almond milk with the vanilla bean seeds and pod until just under boiling. Remove from heat and let steep for 10 minutes.
2. **Whisk Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar and cornstarch.
3. **Combine and Cook**: Return milk to a low heat, remove the vanilla pod, and gradually whisk in the sugar mixture. Continue whisking until thickened.
4. **Finish with Butter**: Remove from heat and stir in the vegan butter and turmeric. Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap touching the surface, and chill.

### Step 3: Prepare the Raspberry Compote
1. **Cook Berries**: In a saucepan, combine raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat until the mixture thickens and the raspberries break down (about 10 minutes).
2. **Cool**: Remove from heat and let cool before transferring to a container.

### Step 4: Bake the Pastry
1. **Preheat and Roll**: Preheat the oven to 200°C (392°F). Roll the dough to about 3-4mm thick. Cut into rectangles.
2. **Bake**: Place rectangles on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Prick dough with a fork to prevent rising. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.

### Step 5: Assemble the Mille-Feuille
1. **Layering**: On a serving plate, lay one rectangle of puff pastry. Spread a layer of crème pâtissière, followed by raspberry compote.
2. **Repeat Layers**: Add another layer of pastry and repeat crème and raspberry layers. Top with a final pastry rectangle.
3. **Optional Decoration**: Dust with icing sugar or drizzle with vegan white chocolate.

### Step 6: Serve
- Pair with a glass of Sauternes Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey 2017 and enjoy the harmony of flavors.
