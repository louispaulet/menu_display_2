### Instructions

#### Prepare the Horseradish Cream
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sour cream, prepared horseradish, lemon juice, salt, and white pepper. Adjust seasoning to taste. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to let the flavors meld.

#### Make the Potato Pancakes
2. Grate the potatoes using the large holes of a box grater. Place them in a large bowl of cold water to prevent browning.
3. Drain the grated potatoes and pat them dry using a clean kitchen towel.
4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the grated potatoes, grated onion, egg, and flour.
5. Season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, then mix until fully combined.
6. Heat a generous amount of vegetable oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
7. Drop tablespoonfuls of the potato mixture into the hot oil, flattening them slightly with the back of a spoon.
8. Fry until golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side.
9. Remove the pancakes to a paper towel-lined tray to drain excess oil.

#### Assemble the Amuse-Bouche
10. Place a small dollop of horseradish cream on each potato pancake.
11. Top with a piece of smoked salmon.
12. Garnish with a small sprig of fresh dill and a couple of capers, if desired.

#### Serve
13. Arrange the miniature potato pancakes on a platter and serve immediately as an amuse-bouche. Pair with Dr. Loosen Riesling Sekt Brut 2018 for a refreshing complement.
