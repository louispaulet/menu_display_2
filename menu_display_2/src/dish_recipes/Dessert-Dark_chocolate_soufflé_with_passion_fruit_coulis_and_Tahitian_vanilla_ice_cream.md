## Ingredients

### For the Dark Chocolate Soufflé
- 200g high-quality dark chocolate (70% cocoa)
- 50g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing
- 4 large eggs, separated
- 100g caster sugar
- Pinch of salt
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 20g cocoa powder, sifted

### For the Passion Fruit Coulis
- 6 passion fruits
- 50g caster sugar
- 1 tbsp water

### For the Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream
- 500ml whole milk
- 250ml heavy cream
- 150g sugar
- 1 Tahitian vanilla bean, split and scraped
- 5 large egg yolks

## Method

### Prepare the Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream
1. In a saucepan, combine the milk, cream, and the scraped seeds of the Tahitian vanilla bean along with the pod.
2. Heat the mixture over medium heat until it is steaming but not boiling.
3. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar and egg yolks until pale and thick.
4. Slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly to temper the eggs.
5. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.
6. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and cool completely.
7. Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.
8. Transfer to a container and freeze until firm.

### Make the Passion Fruit Coulis
1. Cut the passion fruits in half and scoop the pulp into a small saucepan.
2. Add the sugar and water, and stir to combine.
3. Cook over medium heat for 5–7 minutes, until sugar is dissolved and the sauce thickens slightly.
4. Strain through a fine mesh to remove seeds. Set aside to cool.

### Prepare the Dark Chocolate Soufflé
1. Preheat oven to 200°C (392°F). Grease four ramekins with unsalted butter and dust with cocoa powder.
2. Melt the dark chocolate and butter together in a heatproof bowl over simmering water. Stir until smooth, then remove from heat and let cool slightly.
3. In a clean bowl, whisk egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form. Gradually add caster sugar and continue whisking until glossy stiff peaks form.
4. In another bowl, whisk egg yolks with vanilla extract until combined. Slowly incorporate into the melted chocolate mixture.
5. Gently fold one-third of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it, then fold in the remaining whites in two batches, being careful not to deflate the mixture.
6. Divide the batter evenly among prepared ramekins, running your thumb around the edge to create a "moat" that will help the soufflé rise evenly.
7. Place ramekins on a baking sheet and bake for 12–15 minutes, until soufflés have risen and are set.

### To Serve
1. Drizzle each soufflé with the prepared passion fruit coulis.
2. Serve immediately with a generous scoop of Tahitian vanilla ice cream on the side.
3. Pair with Taylor Fladgate 20 Year Old Tawny Port to complement the rich chocolate and tropical fruit notes.

Enjoy your exquisite dessert experience, perfectly balancing the deep chocolate tones with the tangy brightness of passion fruit, rounded out by the creamy floral notes of Tahitian vanilla.
