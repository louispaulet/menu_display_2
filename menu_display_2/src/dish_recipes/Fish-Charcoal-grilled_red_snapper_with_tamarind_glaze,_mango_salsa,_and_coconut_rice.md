## Charcoal-Grilled Red Snapper with Tamarind Glaze, Mango Salsa, and Coconut Rice

### Ingredients:

#### For the Red Snapper:
- 2 whole red snappers (about 1 lb each, cleaned and scaled)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 limes, thinly sliced

#### For the Tamarind Glaze:
- 1/4 cup tamarind paste
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger

#### For the Mango Salsa:
- 1 ripe mango, diced
- 1/4 cup red onion, finely chopped
- 1 jalapeño, seeded and minced
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- Juice of 1 lime
- Salt, to taste

#### For the Coconut Rice:
- 1 cup jasmine rice
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 1 cup water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

### Instructions:

#### Preparing the Tamarind Glaze:
1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine tamarind paste, honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, and ginger.
2. Stir continuously until the mixture begins to simmer, about 5 minutes.
3. Reduce the heat and let it reduce slightly, for an additional 3-4 minutes until the glaze thickens. Remove from heat and set aside.

#### For the Rice:
1. Rinse the jasmine rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
2. In a medium saucepan, combine rinsed rice, coconut milk, water, and salt.
3. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for about 18-20 minutes until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.
4. Remove from heat and let it sit covered for 5 more minutes. Fluff with a fork before serving.

#### For the Mango Salsa:
1. In a bowl, combine diced mango, red onion, jalapeño, cilantro, and lime juice.
2. Mix well and season with salt to taste. Refrigerate until ready to use.

#### Grilling the Red Snapper:
1. Preheat a charcoal grill for medium-high heat.
2. Rinse and pat dry the red snapper. Make 3 diagonal cuts on each side of the fish.
3. Rub fish with olive oil, then season both sides with salt and pepper.
4. Insert lime slices into the cuts made on the fish for added flavor.
5. Place the fish on the grill, directly over the coals. Cook for about 5–7 minutes per side until the skin is crispy and the fish flakes easily with a fork.
6. While grilling, frequently baste the fish with the tamarind glaze using a brush.

#### Plating:
1. Arrange the grilled red snapper on a serving platter.
2. Drizzle additional tamarind glaze over the fish.
3. Serve with a scoop of coconut rice and a generous spoonful of mango salsa on the side.
4. Pair with a glass of Clos des Papes Châteauneuf-du-Pape Blanc 2018 for the ultimate dining experience.
