### Ingredients:

#### For the Choux Pastry:
- 125ml water
- 60g unsalted butter, cubed
- Pinch of salt
- 10g granulated sugar
- 75g all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs, beaten

#### For the Valrhona Chocolate Cream Filling:
- 250ml whole milk
- 60g granulated sugar
- 3 large egg yolks
- 20g cornstarch
- 200g Valrhona chocolate, finely chopped
- 25g unsalted butter, softened
- 1 tsp pure vanilla extract

#### For the Chocolate Glaze:
- 100g Valrhona dark chocolate, finely chopped
- 80ml heavy cream

### Instructions:

#### Make the Choux Pastry:
1. Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium saucepan, combine water, butter, salt, and sugar. Heat over medium until the butter is melted and the mixture begins to boil.
3. Add the flour all at once and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon for about 2-3 minutes, or until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and forms a smooth ball.
4. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
5. Gradually add the beaten eggs, a little at a time, mixing thoroughly until the dough is smooth and glossy.
6. Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a large, plain nozzle and pipe 10cm (4-inch) long strips onto the prepared baking sheet.
7. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown. Cool completely on a wire rack.

#### Prepare the Chocolate Cream:
1. In a saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer over medium heat.
2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together sugar, egg yolks, and cornstarch until pale and thick.
3. Gradually whisk in the hot milk into the egg mixture, then return the mixture to the saucepan.
4. Cook on low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and boils.
5. Remove from heat and stir in the chopped Valrhona chocolate until smooth and melted.
6. Add butter and vanilla, stirring until incorporated.
7. Transfer pastry cream to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap (press the wrap directly onto the surface), and chill for at least 1 hour.

#### Make the Chocolate Glaze:
1. Heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan until it just begins to simmer.
2. Remove from heat and pour over the chopped chocolate in a mixing bowl.
3. Stir until smooth and glossy.

#### Assemble the Éclairs:
1. Once the choux buns are cooled, slice them in half horizontally with a serrated knife.
2. Fill a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle with the chilled chocolate cream.
3. Pipe the cream generously onto the bottom halves of the éclairs, then place the tops back on.
4. Dip the tops of the éclairs into the chocolate glaze and let it set for a few minutes.
