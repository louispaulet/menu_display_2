## Acai Sorbet with Cacao Nibs and Edible Flower Garnish

### Ingredients
- **Acai Sorbet:**
  - 2 cups frozen acai purée
  - 1/2 cup agave syrup
  - 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
  - 1/4 cup coconut water
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- **Toppings:**
  - 2 tablespoons cacao nibs
  - Edible flowers of your choice (such as pansies, violets, or nasturtiums)

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Acai Sorbet
1. **Blend Ingredients**: In a high-speed blender, combine the frozen acai purée, agave syrup, lime juice, coconut water, and vanilla extract. Blend until smooth and creamy.
   
2. **Chill Mixture**: Pour the blended acai mixture into a shallow dish. Cover it with plastic wrap and place it in the freezer. Chill for at least 1 hour, or until it begins to firm up.
   
3. **Churn the Sorbet**: Transfer the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker. Churn according to the manufacturer’s instructions until the sorbet has a smooth, scoopable texture.
   
4. **Freeze**: For a firmer consistency, transfer the sorbet to an airtight container and freeze for an additional 2 hours, or until ready to serve.

#### Assemble the Dish
5. **Scoop and Serve**: Use a warm ice cream scoop to serve the sorbet into chilled dessert bowls.
   
6. **Garnish**: Sprinkle each serving with 1 teaspoon of cacao nibs and carefully place a few edible flowers on top for a visually striking garnish.

### Wine Pairing
- Serve with **Moscato d'Asti Elio Perrone Sourgal 2020**. The light, sweet, and slightly fizzy nature of this wine enhances the rich, fruity notes of the acai while the cacao nibs add an earthy contrast to the wine’s floral aromas.
