#### Instructions:

**For the Stardust Crackers:**
1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. **Prepare Dough:** In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, and charcoal powder. Stir to distribute the ingredients evenly. Add olive oil and mineral water, mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough lightly until smooth.
3. **Roll and Cut:** Divide the dough into two portions. Roll out each portion on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8 inch thickness. Use a star-shaped cookie cutter to cut out crackers.
4. **Bake:** Place crackers on a parchment-lined baking sheet. If desired, place small pieces of edible silver leaf atop crackers for a cosmic sparkle. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until crispy and slightly golden.
5. **Cool:** Allow crackers to cool on a wire rack. 

**For the Cheese Platter:**
1. **Plate the Cheeses:** Arrange the selection of artisanal cheeses from the Milky Way on a large platter or wooden board. Group same cheeses together and leave space for crackers and any optional accompaniments.
2. **Accompaniments (Optional):** Consider adding fresh figs, grapes, candied nuts, or honey for balance and variety.
3. **Serve:** Place cooled Stardust Crackers alongside the cheeses and serve with Gliese 581g Merlot 2995.
