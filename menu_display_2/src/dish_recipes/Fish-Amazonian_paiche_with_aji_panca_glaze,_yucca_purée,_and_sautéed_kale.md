## Instructions:

### Step 1: Prepare the Aji Panca Glaze
1. In a small bowl, mix together the aji panca paste, honey, soy sauce, olive oil, lime juice, salt, and pepper until smooth.
2. Brush the glaze generously over the paiche fillets and let them marinate for at least 15 minutes.

### Step 2: Cook the Yucca Purée

2. Drain the yucca and transfer it to a blender or food processor.

4. Season with salt to taste and keep warm.

### Step 3: Sauté the Kale

4. Drizzle with lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.

### Step 4: Cook the Paiche
1. Preheat a grill pan or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Sear the paiche fillets on each side until cooked through and slightly caramelized, about 4 minutes per side.
3. Brush with additional glaze as they cook if desired.

### Step 5: Assembly
1. Spoon a generous portion of the yucca purée onto each plate.
