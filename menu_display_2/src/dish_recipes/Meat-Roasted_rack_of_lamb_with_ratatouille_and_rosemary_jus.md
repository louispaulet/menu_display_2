- 500ml lamb stock
- 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
- 1 shallot, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp butter

#### Instructions

**1. Prepare the Lamb:**
   - Preheat your oven to 200°C (390°F).
   - In a small bowl, combine minced garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper with olive oil to make a marinade.
   - Rub the marinade all over the lamb racks and let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.

**2. Cook the Ratatouille:**
   - Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
   - Add garlic and onion, sauté until translucent.
   - Add the eggplant, zucchini, and bell peppers. Cook until vegetables begin to soften, about 5-7 minutes.
   - Stir in the chopped tomatoes and thyme. Season with salt and pepper.
   - Cover and let it simmer on low heat for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

**3. Roast the Lamb:**
   - Heat a large ovenproof skillet over high heat.
   - Sear the lamb racks, fat side down, until browned, about 4-5 minutes.
   - Flip and brown the other side for an additional 2 minutes.
   - Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 12-15 minutes for medium-rare, or longer for desired doneness.
   - Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before carving.

**4. Prepare the Rosemary Jus:**
   - In a saucepan, melt butter and add the shallot. Cook until shallot is soft.
   - Stir in the flour to make a roux and cook for 1-2 minutes.
   - Gradually whisk in the red wine, followed by the lamb stock.
   - Add the rosemary sprigs and let the jus simmer until reduced by half, about 15-20 minutes.
   - Season with salt and pepper, strain through a sieve, and keep warm.

**5. Assemble the Dish:**
   - Serve carved lamb chops on a bed of ratatouille, drizzled generously with rosemary jus.
   - Pair with a glass of Moët & Chandon Grand Vintage Rosé 2013 for an exquisite culinary experience.
