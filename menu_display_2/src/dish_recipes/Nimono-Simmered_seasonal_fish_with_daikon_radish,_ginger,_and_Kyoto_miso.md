### Simmered Seasonal Fish with Daikon Radish, Ginger, and Kyoto Miso

#### Ingredients:
- **Fish Fillets** (seasonal, such as sea bass or mackerel) - 4 fillets
- **Daikon Radish** - 1 medium, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch slices
- **Ginger** - 1 inch piece, sliced into thin rounds
- **Water** - 2 cups
- **Light Soy Sauce** - 3 tablespoons
- **Mirin** - 2 tablespoons
- **Sake** - 2 tablespoons
- **Sugar** - 2 teaspoons
- **Kyoto Miso** - 2 tablespoons
- **Spring Onions** - 2, thinly sliced for garnish

#### Instructions:

1. **Preparation:**
   - Begin by cleaning and drying your seasonal fish fillets. Lightly salt them and set aside to absorb some flavor.
   - Prepare the daikon by peeling and slicing into 1/2 inch rounds. Optionally perform hanamaki cuts (edging to resemble a flower when cooked).
   - Slice the ginger into thin rounds.

2. **Simmering Base:**
   - In a shallow pan or pot with a wide base, combine water, light soy sauce, mirin, sake and sugar. Stir occasionally and bring this mixture to a gentle boil over medium heat.

3. **Cooking the Daikon:**
   - Once the liquid is boiling, add the sliced daikon and ginger. Reduce heat to allow the liquid to simmer gently.
   - Cover with a drop lid (or use parchment paper with vents) to ensure even cooking and simmer for about 10 minutes until the daikon is slightly tender.

4. **Adding Fish:**
   - Carefully place the seasoned fish fillets on top of the daikon slices, skin side up if applicable.
   - Cover again with the drop lid and continue to simmer gently for an additional 5-7 minutes, until the fish is just cooked through.

5. **Integrating Miso:**
   - Remove about 1/4 cup of the simmering broth into a separate bowl and dissolve the Kyoto miso completely into it to avoid clumping.
   - Gently pour the dissolved miso mixture back into the pan, ensuring not to agitate the fish.
   - Allow to simmer for another 2-3 minutes to let the miso integrate.

6. **Finishing Touches:**
   - Carefully remove the daikon and fish using a slotted spoon to a serving dish, allowing any excess liquid to drain back into the pan.
   - Spoon a little of the miso-infused simmering liquid over the fish and daikon to glaze.
   - Garnish with thinly sliced spring onions for an aromatic finish.

7. **Serving:**
   - Serve the dish hot alongside bowls of steamed rice and paired with a chilled glass of **Hakutsuru Excellent Junmai Sake** to complement the rich umami flavors of the dish.
