## Preparation Instructions:

### Preparing the Broth:
1. **Char the Aromatics:** Place the onion and ginger under a preheated broiler until they develop a slight char (about 5-10 minutes). Set aside.

2. **Blanch the Bones and Meats:** In a large pot, bring water to a boil, and blanch the beef bones, oxtail, and brisket for 10 minutes to remove impurities. Drain and rinse the bones and meat under cold water.

3. **Simmer:** Fill a clean pot with 6 quarts of water. Add the blanched bones, onion, ginger, daikon, star anise, cloves, cinnamon sticks, and coriander seeds.

4. **Flavoring:** Add the fish sauce, rock sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer.

5. **Cooking Time:** Simmer uncovered for at least 3 hours, skimming off any foamy scum or excess fat. Taste the broth and add more salt or fish sauce to your preference.

6. **Strain:** Once the broth is rich and aromatic, strain it through a fine mesh sieve. Discard solids, and keep the cooked brisket aside. Let cool, then refrigerate if not using immediately (skim the solidified fat from the surface before use).

### Preparing the Noodles and Meat:
1. **Noodles:** Soak the rice noodles in warm water for 30 minutes, then drain. Cook in boiling water for a couple of minutes until tender, then rinse under cold water. Divide among serving bowls.

2. **Beef:** Arrange raw filet mignon slices atop the cooked noodles. Add slices of the cooked brisket if desired.

### Bringing it Together:
1. **Heat and Serve:** Reheat the broth, bringing it back to a rapid boil. Ladle the broth over the beef and noodles in each bowl, which will cook the thinly sliced filet mignon.

2. **Garnishes:** Serve with generous amounts of herbs, sliced onions, bean sprouts, lime wedges, jalapeño slices, hoisin, and Sriracha.

### Tasting Notes:
The broth should have a deep, savory richness with a slight hint of sweetness and a balance of spices. Encourage diners to customize their bowls with lime, herbs, and condiments to achieve their preferred flavor balance.

**Wine Pairing Suggestion:**
Pinot Noir Domaine Drouhin Oregon 2018, with its silky tannins and vibrant acidity, will match beautifully with the flavors and textures of phở tái, enhancing the aromatic experience with each sip.
