#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Reindeer Moss**:
    - In a medium saucepan, combine water, sea salt, and baking soda. Bring to a simmer.
    - Rinse the reindeer moss thoroughly under cold water to remove any dirt.
    - Blanch the reindeer moss in the simmering water mix for 1 minute.
    - Drain and pat dry with a paper towel.

2. **Fry the Reindeer Moss**:
    - Heat the neutral oil in a deep pot to 180°C (355°F).
    - Once heated, carefully place the blanched moss into the oil in small batches.
    - Fry until crispy and slightly puffed, approximately 30-45 seconds.
    - Remove with a spider or slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
    - Season immediately with sea salt.

3. **Prepare the Mushroom Powder**:
    - Combine the dried shiitake and porcini mushrooms in a blender or spice grinder.
    - Blend until a fine powder forms.
    - Pass through a fine sieve to ensure a smooth texture.

4. **Fermented Lingonberries**:
    - In a small bowl, combine lingonberries, sugar, salt, and water.
    - Cover and leave at room temperature for 24 hours to ferment.
    - Once fermented, mash lightly to release some juices.

5. **Assembly**:
    - Arrange the crispy reindeer moss on a serving dish.
    - Lightly dust with the prepared mushroom powder.
    - Dot small amounts of fermented lingonberries over the moss.

#### Wine Pairing:
