### Pan-seared Black Garlic and Porcini-Crusted King Oyster Mushroom 'Scallops' with Saffron-Infused Cauliflower Purée and Microgreens

#### Ingredients:

**For the Mushroom 'Scallops':**
- 4 large king oyster mushrooms, sliced into 1-inch thick scallop-like rounds
- 3 tablespoons black garlic paste
- 2 tablespoons dried porcini mushroom powder
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

**For the Saffron-Infused Cauliflower Purée:**
- 1 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 1 cup vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- A pinch of saffron threads, steeped in 1 tablespoon hot water for 5 minutes
- Salt and white pepper, to taste

**For the Garnish:**
- 1 cup mixed microgreens (such as arugula, beet, and mizuna)
- Drizzle of truffle oil

#### Instructions:

**Prepare the Cauliflower Purée:**
1. In a large pot, bring the vegetable broth to a boil. Add cauliflower florets and reduce heat to simmer. Cover and cook for about 10 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender.
2. Drain, reserving a little cooking liquid. Transfer cauliflower to a blender, add butter, steeped saffron (along with its soaking liquid), and blend until smooth. Add reserved broth as needed to achieve a creamy consistency.
3. Season with salt and white pepper. Keep warm and set aside.

**Prepare the Mushroom 'Scallops':**
1. Pat the king oyster mushroom rounds dry with a paper towel.
2. In a small bowl, mix black garlic paste with olive oil to form a marinade. Brush the mixture all over the mushroom rounds.
3. In a shallow dish, combine porcini mushroom powder with a pinch of salt and pepper.
4. Dredge the oiled mushroom rounds in the porcini powder, pressing gently to adhere.
5. Heat the remaining olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushroom rounds, cooking for 3-4 minutes on each side or until golden brown and slightly crispy.

**Plate the Dish:**
1. Spoon a generous amount of saffron-infused cauliflower purée onto each plate.
2. Arrange 3-4 mushroom 'scallops' atop the purée.
3. Garnish with a handful of microgreens and a drizzle of truffle oil.
