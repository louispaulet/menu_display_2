## Instructions 

### Preparation

1. **Prepare the Lamb Marinade:**
   - Toast the guajillo and ancho chiles in a dry skillet over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until fragrant. Transfer to a bowl and cover with hot water, soaking for 15 minutes until softened.
   - Drain the chiles and transfer them to a blender. Add garlic, onion, apple cider vinegar, cumin, oregano, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth, adding a bit of the soaking water if necessary.

2. **Marinate the Lamb:**
   - Generously rub the lamb with the marinade. Wrap it tightly with banana leaves or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours, preferably overnight.

### Cooking

3. **Slow-cook the Lamb:**
   - Preheat your oven to 275°F (135°C).
   - Place the wrapped lamb in a baking dish and bake for 4-5 hours, or until the lamb is tender and pulls apart easily with a fork.

4. **Prepare the Guajillo Sauce:**
   - In a small pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the guajillo chiles and turn off the heat. Let it steep for 15 minutes.
   - Transfer the chiles to a blender, add garlic, onion, vinegar, sugar, salt, coriander, and chicken stock. Blend until smooth.
   - Pour the sauce into a saucepan and simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes until slightly thickened. Adjust seasoning as needed.

5. **Cook the Nopales:**
   - Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the nopales and sauté for 8-10 minutes, until they start releasing their juices and are tender but slightly crisp.
   - Add lime juice, salt, pepper, and a pinch of oregano. Stir for another minute. Set aside.

### Final Steps

6. **Make the Tortillas:**
   - In a mixing bowl, combine masa harina, salt, and warm water. Knead until a smooth dough forms.
   - Divide the dough into 12 equal balls and flatten each between sheets of parchment paper using a tortilla press or rolling pin.
   - Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each tortilla for 1-2 minutes on each side until slightly puffed and golden.

7. **Assemble Your Dish:**
   - Shred the lamb with two forks, mixing in some of the cooking juices to keep it moist.
   - Serve the lamb with the guajillo sauce drizzled on top, accompanied by sautéed nopales and warm handmade tortillas on the side.

## Wine Pairing
- **Tempranillo Muga Reserva 2017**: The medium-bodied wine with notes of cherry and vanilla complements the rich and earthy flavors of the barbacoa, enhancing the depth of the dish.

Enjoy your meaty, smoky, and flavor-packed lamb barbacoa meal!
