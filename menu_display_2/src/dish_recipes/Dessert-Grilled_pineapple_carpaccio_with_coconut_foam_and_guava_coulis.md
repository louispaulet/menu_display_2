## Instructions

### Prepare the Grilled Pineapple Carpaccio
1. **Peel and Slice Pineapple:**
   - Peel the pineapple and remove the core. Cut into very thin slices, about 1/8 inch thick.

2. **Make Honey Glaze:**
   - In a small bowl, mix honey, cinnamon, and lime juice.

3. **Grill Pineapple:**
   - Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Lightly brush each pineapple slice with the honey glaze.
   - Grill for 1-2 minutes on each side, until caramelized and grill marks appear. Set aside to cool.

### Prepare the Coconut Foam
1. **Foam Mixture:**
   - In a mixing bowl, combine coconut cream, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and coconut extract. Whisk thoroughly until smooth.

2. **Create Foam:**
   - Use a siphon canister (if available) to create foam. Charged with a cream charger and shake well before use.
   - If a siphon is not available, lightly whip the mixture to incorporate some air for a frothy texture.

### Prepare the Guava Coulis
1. **Blend Ingredients:**
   - In a blender, combine the guava flesh with water, sugar, and lemon juice. Blend until smooth.

2. **Strain and Cool:**
   - Strain the puree to remove any pulp. Set aside and refrigerate to chill.

### Assembly
1. **Plate the Carpaccio:**
   - Arrange pineapple slices in an overlapping circular pattern on a serving plate.

2. **Add Coconut Foam:**
   - Spoon or pipe the coconut foam artfully over the arranged pineapple.

3. **Drizzle Guava Coulis:**
   - Spoon the guava coulis over and around the pineapple slices to add color and flavor contrasts.

4. **Garnish and Serve:**
   - Sprinkle toasted coconut flakes around the dish and garnish with fresh mint leaves.

5. **Pair with Wine:**
   - Serve with a chilled glass of Sauternes Château d'Yquem 2011 for an exquisite pairing.

Enjoy this refreshing dessert as a sweet conclusion to any tropical-inspired meal!
