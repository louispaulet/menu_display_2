### Ingredients

- **For the Borscht**
  - 1 lb (450g) beef chuck, cut into 1-inch pieces
  - 2 quarts (1.9 liters) cold water
  - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
  - 1 large onion, finely chopped
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 2 medium beets, peeled and grated
  - 2 medium carrots, peeled and grated
  - 1 medium potato, peeled and diced
  - 1/4 small head of cabbage, shredded

  - Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
  - 1 teaspoon sugar

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Broth:**
   - In a large pot, combine the beef and cold water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
   - As it boils, skim off any foam that rises to the surface. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let simmer for about 1 hour until the beef is tender.

2. **Cook the Vegetables:**
   - In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and saut√© until the onion is translucent.
   - Stir in the grated beets and carrots, and cook for another 5 minutes.
   - Add the tomato paste and vinegar, and stir well to combine. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.

3. **Assemble the Borscht:**
   - To the simmering broth, add the potato, shredded cabbage, and sauteed vegetables.
   - Add the bay leaves, season with salt, pepper, and sugar.
   - Let the soup simmer uncovered for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender.

4. **Adjust Flavor and Serve:**
   - Taste for seasoning and adjust with more salt, pepper, or vinegar if needed. Remove bay leaves.
   - Ladle the borscht into bowls.
   - Garnish each serving with a generous dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of fresh dill.
   - Serve with slices of pumpernickel bread on the side.
