### Salmorejo with Quail Egg and Crispy Serrano Ham

#### Ingredients

##### For the Salmorejo:
- 1 kg ripe tomatoes, chopped
- 200 g stale bread, crust removed
- 100 ml extra virgin olive oil
- 1 clove of garlic, peeled and core removed
- 1 tbsp sherry vinegar
- Salt to taste

##### For the Garnish:
- 4 quail eggs
- 4 slices of Serrano ham
- Extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Fresh chives, chopped (optional)

#### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Salmorejo Base:**
   - Begin by washing and chopping the tomatoes into quarters. This doesn’t need to be exact as it will all be blended.
   - Remove the crust from the stale bread and roughly tear it into pieces.
   - In a large blender or food processor, add the chopped tomatoes and blend until you achieve a smooth consistency.
   - Add the stale bread, extra virgin olive oil, garlic, sherry vinegar, and a generous pinch of salt to the tomato puree.
   - Blend until the mixture is very smooth and creamy. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary, adding more salt or vinegar to taste.
   - Transfer the salmorejo to a bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to chill and allow the flavors to meld.

2. **Prepare the Crispy Serrano Ham:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
   - Place the Serrano ham slices on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
   - Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes or until the ham is crispy but not burnt.
   - Remove from the oven and let them cool on a paper towel. They will crisp up further as they cool.

3. **Cook the Quail Eggs:**
   - Bring a small saucepan of water to a rolling boil.
   - Gently lower the quail eggs into the boiling water and cook for 2 1/2 minutes for a soft-boiled egg.
   - Transfer the eggs to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process. Once cooled, carefully peel the eggs.

4. **Assemble the Dish:**
   - Pour a ladleful of the chilled salmorejo into a shallow serving bowl or plate.
   - Gently place a peeled quail egg in the center of the salmorejo.
   - Break the crispy Serrano ham into rough shards and place around the quail egg.
   - Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, grind some fresh black pepper over the top, and sprinkle with chopped chives if using.

5. **Serving Suggestion:**
   - Enjoy this dish as an appetizer with a glass of Albariño Pazo de Señoráns 2020, which pairs beautifully with the dish’s creamy texture and rich flavors.
