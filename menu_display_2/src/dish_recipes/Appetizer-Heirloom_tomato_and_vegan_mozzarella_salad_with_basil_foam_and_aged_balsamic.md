## Heirloom Tomato and Vegan Mozzarella Salad with Basil Foam and Aged Balsamic

### Ingredients

#### For the Salad:
- 4 medium heirloom tomatoes, various colors
- 200g vegan mozzarella, sliced
- Fresh basil leaves, for garnish
- Microgreens, optional, for garnish
- Flaky sea salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

#### For the Basil Foam:
- 1 cup fresh basil leaves, tightly packed
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 tsp soy lecithin
- Pinch of salt

#### For the Aged Balsamic Reduction:
- 1/2 cup aged balsamic vinegar
- 1 tbsp honey or maple syrup (for a fully vegan option)

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Aged Balsamic Reduction:
1. **Balsamic Reduction:** In a small saucepan, combine the aged balsamic vinegar and honey (or maple syrup). Bring to a simmer over medium heat.
2. **Reduce:** Lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and allow the mixture to reduce by half, stirring occasionally. This should take about 10-15 minutes. The reduction should coat the back of a spoon.
3. **Cool:** Remove from heat and let it cool completely before using.

#### Prepare the Basil Foam:
1. **Blanch Basil:** Bring a small pot of water to a boil, prepare an ice bath. Blanch the basil leaves for 10 seconds, then transfer to the ice bath to cool. Drain and pat dry.
2. **Blend:** In a blender, combine the blanched basil, water, soy lecithin, and a pinch of salt. Blend until smooth and foamy.
3. **Strain:** Strain the mixture through a fine sieve to remove solids, leaving you with a basil-infused liquid.
4. **Foam:** Use an immersion blender to whip the liquid into a foam; this can be done right before serving for best texture.

#### Assemble the Salad:
1. **Slice Tomatoes:** Slice the heirloom tomatoes into rounds and wedges, and arrange them on a serving platter.
2. **Add Mozzarella:** Interweave slices of vegan mozzarella between the tomato slices.
3. **Season:** Lightly sprinkle the salad with flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
4. **Garnish:** Add fresh basil leaves and microgreens if using.
5. **Apply Foam:** Gently spoon or pipe small portions of basil foam over the salad.
6. **Drizzle Reduction:** Drizzle the aged balsamic reduction artfully over the salad.

### Wine Pairing
Pair this fresh and vibrant salad with a chilled glass of Sancerre Domaine Vacheron 2020, whose citrus and mineral notes complement the acidity of the tomatoes and richness of the mozzarella. 

### Tips
- Use a variety of heirloom tomatoes for different colors and flavors.
- Prepare the balsamic reduction and basil foam components just before serving to preserve their intensity and texture.
- If you do not have an immersion blender, shake the basil liquid in a jar with a lid to create a foam.
