### Ingredients:

#### For the Buffalo Mozzarella Foam:
- 200g fresh buffalo mozzarella
- 100ml whole milk
- 50ml cream
- 1g lecithin (optional, for extra foam stability)
- Salt to taste

#### For the Tomato Essence:
- 500g ripe heirloom tomatoes
- 1 small shallot, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 3 sprigs fresh basil
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- Salt to taste

#### For Garnish:
- Fresh basil leaves
- Balsamic glaze
- Microgreens (optional)
- Edible flowers (optional)
- Maldon sea salt
- Freshly cracked black pepper

### Instructions:

#### For the Buffalo Mozzarella Foam:
1. Tear the buffalo mozzarella into small pieces and place in a blender.
2. Add the whole milk and cream to the blender. Blend until completely smooth.
3. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a saucepan to ensure a smooth consistency.
4. Season the mixture with a pinch of salt and add lecithin, if using.
5. Heat the mixture gently over low heat until warm, then pour into a siphon and charge with two gas cartridges. Keep warm in a bain-marie or warm water bath until ready to serve.

#### For the Tomato Essence:
1. Roughly chop the heirloom tomatoes and place them in a large bowl.
2. Add the chopped shallot, minced garlic, and basil sprigs to the bowl with the tomatoes.
3. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt.
4. Mix everything together and crush gently with your hands or the back of a spoon to release the juices.
5. Place the mixture in a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth-lined strainer over another bowl and let it drain naturally in the fridge for several hours or overnight to extract the clear tomato essence.

### To Assemble:
1. On a plate or shallow bowl, spoon a little of the clear tomato essence.
2. Dispense the buffalo mozzarella foam over the tomato essence using the siphon.
3. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, a drizzle of balsamic glaze, microgreens, and edible flowers if using.
4. Sprinkle Maldon sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper over the top.
5. Serve immediately with a glass of Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore Bucci 2019 for a perfect pairing.
