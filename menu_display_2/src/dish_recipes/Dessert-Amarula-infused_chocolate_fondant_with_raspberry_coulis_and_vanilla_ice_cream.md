### Ingredients:

#### For the Chocolate Fondant
- 100g dark chocolate (minimum 70% cocoa), broken into pieces
- 100g unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing molds
- 100g caster sugar
- 50g plain flour
- 2 large eggs
- 2 large egg yolks
- 2 tbsp Amarula liqueur
- Pinch of salt

#### For the Raspberry Coulis
- 200g fresh or frozen raspberries
- 50g icing sugar
- 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice 

#### For the Vanilla Ice Cream
*(You may use store-bought or homemade vanilla ice cream)*

### Equipment:
- Four 150ml ramekins or metal pudding molds
- Baking sheet
- Bowl for mixing
- Saucepan
- Sieve
- Blender or food processor (for coulis)
- Ice cream scoop

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Prepare the Molds
1. Preheat your oven to 200°C (392°F).
2. Generously grease your molds with butter and lightly dust them with flour, then chill in the fridge while you prepare the batter.

#### Step 2: Make the Fondant Batter
1. Melt the chocolate and butter together in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, ensuring the bowl does not touch the water. Stir occasionally until smooth. Alternatively, use the microwave in short bursts.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, egg yolks, Amarula liqueur, and salt until well combined.
3. Carefully fold the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture, taking care not to deflate it.
4. Sift the flour over the top and gently fold it in until smooth.
5. Divide the batter equally among the prepared molds.
6. Place the molds on a baking sheet and bake for 9-11 minutes until the tops are set and the edges begin to pull away from the sides, but the centers are still soft.

#### Step 3: Make the Raspberry Coulis
1. In a blender or food processor, combine the raspberries, icing sugar, and lemon juice. Blend until smooth.
2. Pass the mixture through a fine sieve to remove the seeds, pressing with a spoon or spatula.

#### Step 4: Serve
1. Allow the fondants to cool for a minute in their molds before carefully turning them out onto plates.
2. Decorate each fondant with a drizzle of raspberry coulis.
3. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.
4. Optionally garnish with fresh raspberries for an extra touch of elegance.

### Wine Pairing:
Pair with a glass of **Delaire Graff Botmaskop 2017** for a well-balanced dessert experience that complements the rich flavors of the chocolate and the subtle creaminess of Amarula.
