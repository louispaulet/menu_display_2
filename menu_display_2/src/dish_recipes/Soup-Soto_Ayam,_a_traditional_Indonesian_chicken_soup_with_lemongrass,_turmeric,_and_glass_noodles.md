#### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Stock**: 
   - In a large pot, bring the chicken pieces and water to a boil. Skim off any foam that surfaces to ensure a clear broth.
   - Add the lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, bay leaf, and a pinch of salt to the pot.
   - Reduce the heat and simmer for about 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked and tender.
   - Remove chicken pieces from the pot. Once cool enough to handle, shred the chicken meat and set aside. Reserve the stock.

2. **Make the Spice Paste (Bumbu)**:
   - Blend garlic, shallots, macadamia nuts, turmeric, ginger, coriander, and black pepper together into a smooth paste.
   - Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat and sauté the spice paste until fragrant and cooked, about 5 minutes.

3. **Combine the Soup**:
   - Add the sautéed spice paste to the chicken stock. Stir well to combine.
   - Bring the soup back to a simmer, adjust seasoning with salt as needed.

4. **Assemble the Soup**:
   - Divide the softened glass noodles among serving bowls.
   - Top with shredded chicken, half an egg, and a handful of bean sprouts.
   - Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and toppings.

5. **Garnish and Serve**:
   - Garnish each bowl with spring onions, fried shallots, and fresh cilantro.
   - Serve with lime wedges on the side for an extra citrusy kick.
