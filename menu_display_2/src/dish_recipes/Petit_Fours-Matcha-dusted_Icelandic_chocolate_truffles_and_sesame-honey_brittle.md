# Matcha-dusted Icelandic Chocolate Truffles and Sesame-Honey Brittle Petit Fours

## Wine Pairing
- **Wine**: Sauternes Château Coutet 2016

## Ingredients

### For the Matcha-dusted Icelandic Chocolate Truffles:
- **Icelandic Dark Chocolate (70% cocoa)**: 200g
- **Heavy Cream**: 120ml
- **Unsalted Butter**: 20g
- **Icelandic Sea Salt**: A pinch
- **Matcha Powder**: 2 tablespoons

### For the Sesame-Honey Brittle:
- **Sesame Seeds**: 100g
- **Honey**: 200g
- **Granulated Sugar**: 150g
- **Butter**: 20g
- **Baking Soda**: 1/2 teaspoon
- **Icelandic Flaky Sea Salt**: For sprinkling

## Instructions

### Matcha-dusted Icelandic Chocolate Truffles
1. **Chop the Chocolate**: Finely chop the Icelandic dark chocolate and place it in a heat-proof bowl.

2. **Heat the Cream**: In a saucepan, gently heat the heavy cream over medium heat until just simmering. Remove from heat.

3. **Melt the Chocolate**: Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate. Let it sit for about 2 minutes, then gently stir with a spatula until smooth and fully combined.

4. **Incorporate Butter**: Add the butter and a pinch of Icelandic sea salt to the chocolate mixture, stirring until the butter is fully melted and incorporated.

5. **Chill the Mixture**: Cover the bowl with cling film and refrigerate the chocolate ganache for about 2 hours or until firm enough to handle.

6. **Shape the Truffles**: Using a melon baller or a teaspoon, scoop small amounts of the ganache and quickly roll them between your palms to form truffles. Place them on a parchment-lined tray.

7. **Dust with Matcha**: Sift matcha powder over the truffles, coating them lightly yet evenly. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

### Sesame-Honey Brittle
1. **Prepare a Baking Sheet**: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.

2. **Toast the Sesame Seeds**: In a dry skillet, toast the sesame seeds over medium heat until golden and fragrant. Set aside.

3. **Melt the Sugar**: In a saucepan over medium heat, combine honey and granulated sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture turns a deep amber color.

4. **Add Butter and Baking Soda**: Remove from heat and quickly stir in the butter until melted. Then add the baking soda while stirring constantly; the mixture will foam and become lighter.

5. **Incorporate Sesame Seeds**: Stir in the toasted sesame seeds quickly to combine.

6. **Set the Brittle**: Pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, spreading it out thinly with a spatula. Sprinkle with flaky Icelandic sea salt while warm.

7. **Cool and Break**: Allow the brittle to cool completely. Break into bite-sized pieces and serve alongside the matcha-dusted truffles.

Enjoy the harmonious flavors of earthy matcha, intense chocolate, and nutty sesame accompanied by the elegant sweetness of Sauternes Château Coutet.
