## Instructions

### Step 1: Make the Chocolate Mousse
1. **Melt the Chocolate**: Place the dark chocolate in a double boiler or heat-proof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. Stir until completely melted and smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
   
2. **Prepare the Egg Mixture**: Separate the eggs. Beat the egg yolks with half of the sugar until pale and thick. Stir the melted chocolate into the egg yolk mixture until well combined.

3. **Whip the Cream**: In a separate bowl, whisk the heavy cream until it forms soft peaks. Gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate and egg yolk mixture.

4. **Beat the Egg Whites**: Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until foamy. Gradually add the remaining sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks form.

5. **Combine**: Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture in three parts, being careful not to deflate the mixture.

6. **Chill**: Spoon the mousse into serving glasses or dishes. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or until set.

### Step 2: Prepare the Hazelnut Praline
1. **Caramelize the Sugar**: Place the granulated sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Allow the sugar to melt and caramelize into a golden-brown color, swirling the pan gently to ensure even cooking (do not stir).

2. **Combine with Hazelnuts**: Once the sugar is caramelized, remove from heat and quickly stir in the toasted hazelnuts.

3. **Cool and Set**: Pour the praline mixture onto a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat or parchment paper, spreading it thinly. Allow it to cool completely.

4. **Break and Crush**: Once cooled and set, break the praline into pieces and crush into fine bits or a coarse powder, depending on preference.

### Step 3: Assemble and Serve
1. **Top the Mousse**: Before serving, sprinkle the crushed hazelnut praline over the chocolate mousse for added texture and flavor.

2. **Decorate**: Optionally, place a small piece of edible gold leaf on top for an elegant touch.

3. **Pair with Wine**: Serve alongside a glass of Domaine de Rancy Rivesaltes Ambr√© Hors d'Age 2000 to complement the rich flavors of the dessert.

Enjoy your exquisite dessert! This luxurious dish is sure to impress at any dinner party.
