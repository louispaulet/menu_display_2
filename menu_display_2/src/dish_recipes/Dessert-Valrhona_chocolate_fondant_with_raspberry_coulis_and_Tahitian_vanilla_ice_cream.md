- **200g caster sugar**
- **4 large eggs**
- **4 large egg yolks**
- **80g all-purpose flour**
- **1 tsp vanilla extract**
- **Pinch of salt**

### Raspberry Coulis
- **250g fresh raspberries**
- **50g caster sugar**
- **Juice of half a lemon**
- **1 tbsp water**

### Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream
- **500ml whole milk**
- **250ml heavy cream**
- **150g sugar**
- **1 vanilla bean**
- **6 large egg yolks**
- **Pinch of salt**

## Instructions

### Chocolate Fondant
1. **Preheat oven:** Set your oven to 200째C (392째F). Grease six small ramekins with butter and dust with cocoa powder.
2. **Melt chocolate and butter:** In a heatproof bowl, melt the Valrhona chocolate and butter over a simmering pot of water. Stir until smooth and set aside to cool slightly.
3. **Whip eggs and sugar:** In a mixing bowl, beat caster sugar, whole eggs, and egg yolks until pale and thick.
4. **Combine:** Gently fold the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture. Add the vanilla extract and pinch of salt, mixing until just combined.
5. **Add flour:** Sift the flour over the mixture and gently fold it in until you see no streaks of flour.
6. **Fill ramekins:** Divide the mixture evenly between the prepared ramekins.
7. **Bake:** Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes. The edges should be set while the center remains slightly soft.
8. **Cool:** Allow to cool for one minute before running a knife around the edge and inverting onto plates.

### Raspberry Coulis
1. **Cook raspberries:** In a medium saucepan, combine raspberries, sugar, lemon juice, and water. Cook over medium heat until the raspberries break down, about 10 minutes.
2. **Strain:** Remove from heat and strain through a fine sieve to remove seeds. Chill coulis in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

### Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream
1. **Heat milk and cream:** In a saucepan, combine milk, cream, and a pinch of salt. Split the vanilla bean, scrape out the seeds, and add both seeds and pod to the mixture. Heat until just below boiling.
2. **Temper eggs:** In a separate bowl, whisk egg yolks and sugar until pale. Gradually pour the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks while whisking constantly to avoid curdling.
3. **Cook custard:** Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until it coats the back of a spoon (about 76째C/169째F).
4. **Chill:** Strain the mixture through a sieve into a bowl, discarding the vanilla pod. Chill the custard until completely cool.
5. **Churn**: Once cool, churn the mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.

## To Serve
- Place the chocolate fondant on a serving plate.
- Drizzle raspberry coulis around the plate.
- Add a scoop of Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream on the side.
- Pair this exquisite dessert with a glass of **Banyuls Domaine La Tour Vieille 2018** to complement the rich chocolate flavors.
