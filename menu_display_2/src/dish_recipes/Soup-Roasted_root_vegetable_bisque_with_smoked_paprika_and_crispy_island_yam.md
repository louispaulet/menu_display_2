### Ingredients

#### For the Bisque:
- 3 large carrots, peeled and roughly chopped
- 2 parsnips, peeled and roughly chopped
- 1 large sweet potato, peeled and roughly chopped
- 1 small butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cubed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 4 cups vegetable stock
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves

#### For the Crispy Island Yam:
- 1 large yam (preferably purple yam or island yam), peeled and sliced thinly
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- Sea salt, to taste

### Garnish:
- Fresh chives, chopped
- Smoked paprika dusting

### Instructions

#### Roasting the Vegetables:
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. In a large bowl, toss the carrots, parsnips, sweet potato, and butternut squash with olive oil, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.
3. Spread the vegetables evenly on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until they are tender and golden brown.

#### Preparing the Bisque:
4. Transfer the roasted vegetables to a large pot. Add the vegetable stock, coconut milk, bay leaf, and thyme.
5. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Let it cook for about 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
6. Remove the bay leaf and blend the mixture using an immersion blender until smooth. Alternatively, transfer in batches to a stand blender and puree until smooth.
7. Pass the bisque through a fine sieve or chinois to ensure a velvety texture.
8. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if needed. Keep warm on low heat.

#### Making the Crispy Island Yam:
9. Heat vegetable oil in a small frying pan over medium-high heat.
10. Once the oil is hot, add the thinly sliced yam in batches. Fry until golden and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side.
11. Remove the yam slices with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel. Season lightly with sea salt while still warm.

### Serving:
12. Ladle the bisque into warm bowls.
13. Garnish with crispy island yam slices, a sprinkle of fresh chives, and a light dusting of smoked paprika.
14. Serve immediately paired with a chilled glass of Sauvignon Blanc Cloudy Bay Te Koko 2017.

### Chef's Tip:
- To enhance the smoked paprika flavor, consider adding a pinch to the bisque just before serving.
- For texture variation, consider serving with a dollop of crème fraîche or a swirl of extra coconut milk.
