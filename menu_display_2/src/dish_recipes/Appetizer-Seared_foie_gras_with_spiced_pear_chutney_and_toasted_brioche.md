## Ingredients

### For the Foie Gras:
- 4 slices of foie gras, about 1/2-inch thick
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

### For the Spiced Pear Chutney:
- 2 ripe pears, peeled, cored, and diced
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 3 cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- Pinch of salt

### For the Toasted Brioche:
- 4 slices of brioche bread
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened

### Garnish:
- Fresh microgreens (optional)
- Reduced balsamic vinegar (optional)

## Instructions

### Prepare the Spiced Pear Chutney:
1. In a medium saucepan, combine pears, sugar, apple cider vinegar, water, cinnamon stick, cloves, ginger, lemon juice, and salt.
2. Set over medium heat, bring to a simmer, and cook until the pears are soft and the mixture is thickened, about 20-25 minutes.
3. Remove from heat, discard the cinnamon stick and cloves, and let the chutney cool to room temperature.

### Prepare the Brioche:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Spread butter on both sides of the brioche slices.
3. Arrange the brioche on a baking sheet.
4. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Flip halfway through for even toasting.

### Prepare the Foie Gras:
1. Season the foie gras slices with salt and pepper on both sides.
2. Heat the butter in a skillet over high heat.
3. Add the foie gras slices and sear until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes per side.
4. Remove from skillet and place on a paper towel to drain excess fat.

### Assemble the Dish:
1. Place a slice of toasted brioche on each serving plate.
2. Top each slice with a seared piece of foie gras.
3. Spoon a generous dollop of spiced pear chutney beside or on top of the foie gras.
4. Garnish with fresh microgreens and a drizzle of reduced balsamic vinegar if desired.

### Wine Pairing
Pair this luxurious appetizer with a glass of Château Rieussec Sauternes 2017 to complement the richness of the foie gras and the sweetness of the chutney.

### Tips:
- Ensure the foie gras is very cold before searing for better handling and less shrinkage.
- Adjust sugar and spices in the chutney as per taste for a balanced flavor.
