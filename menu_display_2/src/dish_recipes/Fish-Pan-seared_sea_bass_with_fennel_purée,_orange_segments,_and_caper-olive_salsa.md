# Pan-Seared Sea Bass with Fennel Purée, Orange Segments, and Caper-Olive Salsa

**Wine Pairing:** Falanghina Feudi di San Gregorio 2020

## Ingredients:

### Sea Bass:
- 4 fillets of sea bass (skin on, about 150g each)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

### Fennel Purée:
- 2 large fennel bulbs, trimmed and sliced thinly
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 cup vegetable or fish stock
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Caper-Olive Salsa:
- 2 tablespoons capers, rinsed and chopped
- 1/4 cup olives (preferably a mix of green and black), pitted and chopped
- 1 small shallot, finely diced
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

### Garnish:
- 2 oranges, segmented
- Fresh dill or fennel fronds

## Instructions:

### For the Fennel Purée:
1. **Cook Fennel:** In a medium-sized saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the fennel slices and cook until softened, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. **Simmer:** Add the stock, bring to a simmer, and cook until the fennel is very tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 15 minutes.
3. **Blend:** Using a blender or immersion blender, process the fennel mixture until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. **Keep Warm:** Transfer to a small pot, cover, and keep warm over low heat.

### For the Salsa:
1. **Combine Ingredients:** In a bowl, combine the capers, olives, shallot, and parsley.
2. **Dress Salsa:** Add the lemon juice and olive oil, mix, and season with salt and pepper. Let sit for at least 10 minutes to meld flavors.

### For the Sea Bass:
1. **Prepare Sea Bass:** Pat the sea bass fillets dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper.
2. **Sear:** Heat olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Place fillets skin-side down, pressing gently to ensure skin makes firm contact with the pan.
3. **Cook:** Allow to cook undisturbed until skin is crispy and golden, about 4-5 minutes. Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until the fish is just cooked through.
4. **Rest:** Remove from the pan and let rest for a minute.

### To Serve:
1. **On Plates:** On each plate, spread a generous spoonful of fennel purée.
2. **Place Fish:** Lay the sea bass fillet, skin-side up, over the purée.
3. **Add Salsa and Garnish:** Spoon some caper-olive salsa over the fish, arrange orange segments around, and garnish with fresh dill or fennel fronds.
