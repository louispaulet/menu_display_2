#### Pickled Pineapple
- 1 cup pineapple, diced

- 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes

### Instructions

#### Pickled Pineapple
1. **Prepare Pickling Solution:** In a small saucepan, combine rice vinegar, sugar, and chili flakes. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
2. **Pickle Pineapple:** Place the diced pineapple in a heatproof bowl and pour the pickling solution over it. Let it sit for at least one hour, preferably overnight in the fridge. Add fresh mint just before serving.

#### Pork Tenderloin
1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. **Season and Sear:** Season the pork tenderloin with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork and sear on all sides until browned.
3. **Roast:** Add smashed garlic and thyme to the skillet. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the pork for 15-20 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F (63°C).
4. **Rest:** Remove from oven and let the pork rest for 5-10 minutes.

#### Tamarind Glaze
1. **Mix Ingredients:** In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine tamarind pulp, brown sugar, soy sauce, rice vinegar, grated ginger, and minced garlic.
2. **Simmer:** Bring to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.
3. **Strain:** Strain the sauce to remove any solids and set aside to cool slightly.

#### Breadfruit Purée
1. **Prepare Breadfruit:** Peel and core the breadfruit, cutting it into chunks.
2. **Cook:** Place in a pot, cover with water, and boil until tender, about 20-25 minutes.
3. **Mash and Mix:** Drain and place in a food processor or blender. Add coconut milk, butter, salt, and white pepper. Blend until smooth.

### Assembly
1. **Slice Pork:** Slice the rested pork tenderloin into medallions.
2. **Plate:** On each dish, start with a dollop of breadfruit purée, placing the pork medallions on top.
3. **Glaze:** Drizzle tamarind glaze over the pork.
4. **Garnish:** Distribute the pickled pineapple around the dish.
5. **Serve:** Serve warm and enjoy with a glass of Pinot Noir.
