### Ingredients

- 2 medium beetroots, grated
- 100g coarse sea salt
- 100g granulated sugar
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1 tbsp freshly cracked black pepper
- 1 bunch fresh dill, roughly chopped
- 100ml vodka

#### For the Horseradish Cream:
- 100ml crème fraîche
- 2 tbsp freshly grated horseradish
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- Salt and white pepper, to taste

### Wine Pairing

### Instructions

#### To Cure the Sturgeon:
1. **Prepare the Curing Mix:** In a large bowl, combine the grated beetroots, sea salt, sugar, lemon zest, black pepper, and chopped dill. Mix thoroughly.

2. **Prepare the Sturgeon:** Rinse the sturgeon fillets under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.

3. **Curing Process:** Place a large piece of plastic wrap on a flat surface. Spread a layer of the beetroot curing mix onto the plastic wrap, roughly the size of the sturgeon fillets.

4. **Marinate the Fish:** Lay the sturgeon fillets on top of the mixture and then cover them with the remaining curing mix. Pour the vodka evenly over the fillets.

5. **Wrap and Cure:** Wrap the fillets tightly in the plastic wrap, then place them in a shallow dish to catch any juices that may leak. Refrigerate for 24-48 hours.

6. **Rinse and Dry:** After curing, rinse the fillets thoroughly under cold water to remove the curing mix. Pat dry with paper towels.

#### To Make the Horseradish Cream:
1. **Mix the Cream:** In a small bowl, combine crème fraîche, freshly grated horseradish, lemon juice, salt, and white pepper. Mix until well combined. Adjust seasoning to taste.

#### To Serve:
1. **Slice the Sturgeon:** Using a sharp knife, thinly slice the cured sturgeon.

2. **Plate the Dish:** Arrange the slices neatly on a chilled serving dish. Serve alongside the horseradish cream, garnishing with additional dill if desired.

3. **Wine Pairing:** Pour a chilled glass of Chablis Domaine Laroche Saint Martin 2019 to accompany the dish.
