#### Instructions

**Coconut Panna Cotta:**
1. In a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over cold water and let it stand for about 5 minutes to bloom.
2. In a medium saucepan, combine coconut milk, heavy cream, and sugar. Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is hot but not boiling.
3. Remove the saucepan from heat and whisk in the bloomed gelatin until completely dissolved.
4. Stir in the vanilla extract.
5. Pour the mixture into ramekins or molds and let them cool at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until set.

**Passion Fruit Coulis:**
1. Cut the passion fruits in half and scoop out the pulp into a small saucepan.
2. Add sugar and lemon juice to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture slightly thickens (about 5 minutes).
3. Remove from heat and allow to cool.

**Toasted Coconut Flakes:**
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Spread the coconut flakes in a single layer on a baking sheet.
3. Toast in the oven for about 5-7 minutes or until golden brown, stirring occasionally to ensure even toasting.

**Assembly:**
1. To serve, gently run a knife around the edge of the panna cotta and invert it onto a plate.
2. Spoon passion fruit coulis over the panna cotta.
3. Sprinkle toasted coconut flakes on top.

**Wine Pairing:**
- Serve with Domaine des Baumard Quarts de Chaume 2017, a sweet wine with notes of honey and dried fruits, complementing the tropical flavors of the dessert.

Enjoy your elegant and tropical dessert!
