# Mini Raspberry Macarons with Rose Petal Cream

### Wine Pairing:
Château d'Yquem Sauternes 2017

### Ingredients:

#### For the Macaron Shells:
- 125g ground almonds
- 125g icing sugar
- 90g egg whites, aged overnight
- 110g castor sugar
- Pinch of cream of tartar
- Pink food coloring (gel preferred)

#### For the Rose Petal Cream Filling:
- 125g unsalted butter, softened
- 150g icing sugar
- 2 tbsp raspberry puree
- 1 tsp rose water
- Pink rose petals (edible), finely chopped

#### For Decoration:
- Fresh raspberries
- Edible rose petals

### Instructions:

#### Prepare the Macaron Shells:
1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 150°C (300°F), fan-forced.
2. **Sift Dry Ingredients:** Sift the ground almonds and icing sugar together, discarding any large particles. Repeat this process twice to ensure a fine mixture.
3. **Whip the Egg Whites:** In a clean bowl, start beating the egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and continue beating until soft peaks form.
4. **Add Sugar and Color:** Gradually add the castor sugar, one tablespoon at a time, beating well between additions. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form and the mixture becomes glossy. Add the food coloring and beat until combined.
5. **Macaronage:** Gently fold the almond mixture into the meringue, using a spatula. Mix until you achieve a "lava-like" consistency — it should flow off the spatula in thick ribbons.
6. **Pipe the Shells:** Transfer the batter into a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Pipe small circles (about 3 cm in diameter) onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Tap the baking sheet on the counter to release any air bubbles.
7. **Rest the Shells:** Allow the macaron shells to sit at room temperature for 20-30 minutes to form a skin. They should not stick to your fingertip when touched lightly.
8. **Bake:** Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes. Check after 12 minutes — the macarons should easily lift off the baking sheet when they are done.
9. **Cool:** Let the shells cool completely on a wire rack.

#### Prepare the Rose Petal Cream Filling:
1. **Beat the Butter:** In a bowl, beat the softened butter until pale and fluffy.
2. **Add Icing Sugar:** Gradually add in the icing sugar, beating well after each addition.
3. **Flavor the Cream:** Mix in the raspberry puree and rose water. Fold in the finely chopped rose petals.
4. **Chill:** Refrigerate the filling for about 20 minutes to firm up slightly before piping.

#### Assemble the Macarons:
1. **Match Shells:** Pair the macaron shells by size and shape.
2. **Pipe Filling:** Spoon the rose petal cream into a piping bag fitted with a small round tip. Pipe a small amount of filling onto the flat side of a shell, and gently sandwich with the matching shell.
3. **Decorate:** Garnish with fresh raspberries and a sprinkle of edible rose petals on top of each macaron.

#### Serving Suggestion:
- **Plate your macarons on a tiered stand or elegant serving platter.**
- **Pair with a glass of Château d'Yquem Sauternes 2017 to complement the delicate flavors.**

### Chef's Tips:
- Aging Egg Whites: This helps to stabilize the meringue.
- Resting Time: Crucial for achieving the classic macaron "feet."
- Storage: Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Macarons often taste better after a day of “maturing” in the fridge.
