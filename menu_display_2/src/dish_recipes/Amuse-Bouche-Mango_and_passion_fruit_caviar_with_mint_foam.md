#### Instructions:

**Step 1: Prepare the Caviar Base**
1. Blend the mango pieces and passion fruit puree together until smooth.
2. Add sugar and mix until the sugar dissolves completely.

2. Cover and set aside.

**Step 3: Set the Caviar**
1. Using a small syringe or spherical mold, carefully drop the mango-passion fruit mixture into the calcium bath, creating small spheres (caviars).
2. Let the caviars sit in the bath for 1-2 minutes or until they hold their shape.
3. Retrieve the caviars using a strainer, rinse in cold water, and set aside on a plate.

**Step 4: Prepare the Mint Foam**
1. Combine water and sugar in a small saucepan. Heat gently until the sugar dissolves completely.
2. Remove from heat and add fresh mint leaves. Steep for 5 minutes.
3. Strain the mixture to remove the mint leaves.
4. Stir in the soy lecithin and blend with an immersion blender until foam forms.

**Step 5: Assemble the Amuse-Bouche**
1. Spoon the mango and passion fruit caviar into small serving dishes.
2. Top each dish with a light layer of mint foam.
