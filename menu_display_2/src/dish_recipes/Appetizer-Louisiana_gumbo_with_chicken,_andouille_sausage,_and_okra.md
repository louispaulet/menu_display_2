# Louisiana Gumbo with Chicken, Andouille Sausage, and Okra

## Ingredients:

- **For the Roux:**
  - 1/2 cup vegetable oil
  - 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

- **Gumbo Base:**
  - 1 large onion, finely chopped
  - 1 green bell pepper, finely chopped
  - 2 celery stalks, finely chopped
  - 4 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 lb andouille sausage, sliced
  - 1 1/2 lbs bone-in, skinless chicken thighs
  - 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
  - 1 teaspoon dried thyme
  - 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, adjust for heat preference)
  - 1 (14 oz) can diced tomatoes, undrained
  - 1 quart chicken stock
  - 2 cups sliced fresh or frozen okra
  - Salt and pepper to taste
  - 2 bay leaves

- **To Serve:**
  - Cooked white rice
  - Sliced green onions
  - Fresh parsley, chopped
  
## Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Roux:**
   - In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, combine the vegetable oil and flour over medium heat. Whisk constantly to make a roux, cooking until it reaches a deep brown color, about 15 to 20 minutes. Lower the heat if necessary to prevent burning.

2. **Add the Holy Trinity:**
   - Once the roux is ready, add the onions, bell pepper, and celery. Saut√© the vegetables in the roux until they are tender and fragrant, about 5 minutes.

3. **Season and Add Proteins:**
   - Stir in the garlic, then add the sliced andouille sausage and chicken thighs. Season with Cajun seasoning, dried thyme, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until the chicken is lightly browned on all sides.

4. **Simmer the Gumbo:**
   - Add the tomatoes (with juices), chicken stock, okra, and bay leaves. Stir well to combine. Bring the gumbo to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cover and cook for about 1 hour, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.

5. **Adjust Seasoning:**
   - Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper if needed. Discard the bay leaves.

6. **Serve:**
   - Serve hot over cooked white rice. Garnish with sliced green onions and freshly chopped parsley.

## Wine Pairing:
- Enjoy your flavorful Louisiana gumbo with a glass of Zinfandel Ridge Vineyards East Bench 2018. This wine's rich blackberry flavors and peppery notes complement the spice and earthiness of the gumbo beautifully.

### Chef's Tips:
- For a deeper flavor, let the gumbo sit for a few hours or overnight in the fridge before reheating and serving.
- Make sure to continuously stir the roux to prevent it from burning. A burnt roux will affect the flavor of the entire dish.
- Feel free to add shrimp or crab for a seafood twist.
