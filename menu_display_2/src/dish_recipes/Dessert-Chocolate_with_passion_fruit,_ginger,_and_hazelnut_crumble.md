## Instructions

### Chocolate Ganache:
1. **Prepare the Chocolate:** Place the chopped dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl.
2. **Heat the Cream:** In a small saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat until it just begins to simmer.
3. **Combine:** Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let it sit for a minute. Stir until smooth.
4. **Add Butter:** Stir in the butter until fully incorporated.
5. **Chill:** Pour the ganache into a shallow dish, cover with plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours or until set.

### Passion Fruit Curd:
1. **Extract Passion Fruit Juice:** Scoop out the pulp from the passion fruits and push it through a sieve to extract the juice. Discard seeds.
2. **Cook Mixture:** In a medium saucepan, combine passion fruit juice, sugar, butter, and salt. Melt over low heat until sugar dissolves.
3. **Whisk Eggs:** Whisk together the egg yolks and egg in a separate bowl. Slowly whisk into the passion fruit mixture.
4. **Thicken the Curd:** Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the curd thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Do not let it boil.
5. **Strain:** Strain the curd through a sieve and chill until needed.

### Ginger and Hazelnut Crumble:
1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. **Create Mixture:** In a bowl, mix the flour, toasted hazelnuts, butter, sugar, ground ginger, and salt. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour until you achieve a breadcrumb-like consistency.
3. **Bake:** Spread the mixture on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden. Let cool before breaking into chunks.

### Assemble and Serve:
1. **Plate the Ganache:** Place a generous spoonful of chilled chocolate ganache on each dessert plate.
2. **Add Passion Fruit Curd:** Spoon or pipe dollops of passion fruit curd around the ganache.
3. **Sprinkle Crumble:** Generously scatter the ginger and hazelnut crumble around the plate.
4. **Garnish:** Top with fresh passion fruit pulp and edible flowers for a vibrant presentation.
