## Ingredients

### Salad
- 2 medium potatoes, boiled and cubed
- 150g green beans, trimmed and blanched
- 1 cup of bean sprouts, rinsed
- 200g tofu, cut into cubes and fried until golden
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and halved
- 100g cucumbers, thinly sliced
- 1 carrot, julienned or shredded
- 100g cabbage, shredded and steamed
- 1 small bunch of fresh lettuce leaves
- 50g tempeh, sliced and fried (optional)

### Peanut Sauce
- 200g peanuts, roasted or store-bought roasted unsalted peanuts
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 small red chilies, deseeded and finely chopped (adjust for spice level)
- 1 small shallot, chopped
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon tamarind paste
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 1/4 cup water
- Salt to taste
- Juice of 1 lime
- 2 tablespoons of sweet soy sauce (kecap manis), for serving

## Instructions

### Peanut Sauce
1. **Prepare Peanuts**: If using whole peanuts, grind them in a food processor until you achieve a coarse texture. Alternatively, use a store-bought chunky peanut butter.
   
2. **Cook Aromatics**: Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Saut√© garlic, chilies, and shallots until fragrant and softened, about 2-3 minutes.

3. **Combine Ingredients**: Add ground peanuts to the pan. Stir in brown sugar, tamarind paste, and coconut milk. Gradually add water to thin the sauce to desired consistency.

4. **Season**: Let the sauce simmer for about 5 minutes. Stir frequently to avoid sticking. Add salt to taste and finish with a squeeze of lime juice. Set aside to cool.

### Salad Assembly
1. **Prepare Vegetables**: Ensure all vegetables are prepped (boiled, blanched, or fresh) and ready for assembly on a large platter.

2. **Layer**: Start with a bed of fresh lettuce leaves. Arrange potatoes, green beans, bean sprouts, tofu, sliced cucumbers, carrots, and cabbage artfully atop the lettuce.

3. **Add Protein**: Place sliced hard-boiled eggs and fried tempeh on the sides.

4. **Serve with Sauce**: Pour generous amounts of the warm peanut sauce over the salad. Drizzle sweet soy sauce (kecap manis) on top for added sweetness.

## Pairing Suggestion
Serve this appetizer with a chilled glass of Domaine Laroche Chablis Saint Martin 2019. Its fresh and citrus notes complement the rich flavors of the peanut sauce beautifully.

Enjoy your vibrant and flavorful gado-gado salad, a true taste of Indonesia!
