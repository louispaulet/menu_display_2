### Instructions

#### Fig Jam:
1. **Prepare Fig Jam:**
   - In a medium saucepan, combine figs, sugar, and water. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.
   - Reduce heat to low, add lemon juice and vanilla extract. Stir gently.
   - Simmer for about 15-20 mins, stirring occasionally, until figs are soft and mixture thickens to a jam consistency.
   - Remove from heat and let cool. Transfer to a jar for serving.

#### Za'atar Flatbread:
2. **Prepare Dough:**
   - In a large bowl, mix the warm water and yeast. Let it sit until it foams (~5 mins).
   - Add flour and salt, then pour in 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
   - Mix until dough forms. Knead for about 10 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic.
   - Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth and let it rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size.

3. **Cook Flatbread:**
   - Preheat the oven to 220°C (430°F).
   - Punch down the dough and divide into 3 parts. Roll each part into round flatbreads on a floured surface.
   - Place flatbreads on a baking sheet.
   - Brush with remaining olive oil and sprinkle generously with za'atar.
   - Bake for 8-10 minutes until golden brown.
   - Cut into wedges for serving.
