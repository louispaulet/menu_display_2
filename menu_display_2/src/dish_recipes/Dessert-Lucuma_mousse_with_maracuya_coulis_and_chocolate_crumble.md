## Instructions

### Step 1: Make the Lucuma Mousse
1. **Prepare the gelatin:** In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let it sit for 5 minutes to bloom.
2. **Heat gelatin:** Place the bloomed gelatin in the microwave or over a double boiler just until it melts.
3. **Blend lucuma pulp:** In a blender, combine lucuma pulp, sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth.
4. **Mix gelatin into lucuma blend:** Add the melted gelatin to the lucuma mixture, make sure it's fully incorporated.
5. **Whip the cream:** In a chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the lucuma mixture until uniform.
6. **Chill:** Pour the mousse into serving glasses or a large serving dish, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until set.

### Step 2: Prepare the Maracuya Coulis
1. **Combine ingredients:** In a small saucepan, combine passion fruit juice and sugar.
2. **Heat the mixture:** Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add the cornstarch slurry to the saucepan, stirring constantly until it thickens.
3. **Cool down:** Remove from heat and let cool. Chill until ready to serve with mousse.

### Step 3: Make the Chocolate Crumble
1. **Preheat oven:** Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
2. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and salt.
3. **Incorporate butter:** Add the butter cubes and, using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work the mixture into a crumbly texture.
4. **Bake crumble:** Spread the crumble mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until crispy.
5. **Cool down:** Allow to cool before using.

## Assembly
1. **Layering:** Just before serving, drizzle the maracuya coulis over the top of the lucuma mousse.
2. **Garnish with crumble:** Sprinkle the chocolate crumble generously on top or around the dessert for added texture.
3. **Serve:** Pair with a glass of Susana Balbo Late Harvest Malbec 2017 to complement the dessert flavors splendidly.

## Notes
- Lucuma can be sourced from specialty grocery stores if not locally available; often sold frozen or as a puree.
- Consistency of mousse might vary based on the richness of lucuma, adjust the gelatin accordingly.
- Variations in the sweetness of passion fruit can occur, adjust sugar in the coulis as needed.

Enjoy your delicious and exotic dessert, tinged with the flavors of tropical lucuma and tangy passion fruit, perfectly offset by the bittersweet chocolate crumble!
