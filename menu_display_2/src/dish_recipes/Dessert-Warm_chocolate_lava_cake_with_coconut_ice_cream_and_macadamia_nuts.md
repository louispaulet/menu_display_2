#### Ingredients

**For the Lava Cake:**
- 200g high-quality dark chocolate (70% cocoa)
- 100g unsalted butter
- 150g granulated sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 3 large egg yolks
- 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 50g all-purpose flour
- 1/4 tsp salt

**For the Coconut Ice Cream:**
- 400ml coconut milk
- 200ml heavy cream
- 150g granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp coconut extract
- 4 large egg yolks

**For Garnish:**
- 100g macadamia nuts, toasted and chopped
- 50g dark chocolate shavings (optional)

#### Instructions

**To Make the Lava Cake:**
1. Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F). Generously butter four individual ramekins and dust with cocoa powder, shaking out the excess.

2. Melt the dark chocolate and butter together in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.

3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla extract until thick and pale.

4. Gently fold the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mix until well combined.

5. Sift in the flour and salt, and fold gently until incorporated.

6. Divide the batter equally among the prepared ramekins. Place them on a baking sheet and bake for 12-14 minutes, until the sides are firm but the center is soft.

7. Remove from the oven and let the cakes rest for 1 minute before carefully inverting onto serving plates.

**To Make the Coconut Ice Cream:**
1. In a saucepan, combine the coconut milk, heavy cream, and half of the sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.

2. In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the remaining sugar until pale. Gradually whisk a third of the hot coconut mixture into the yolks.

3. Pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan, stirring constantly over low heat until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon.

4. Remove from heat and stir in the coconut extract. Allow to cool completely.

5. Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for 2 hours, then churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Freeze until firm.

**To Serve:**
1. Place the warm chocolate lava cake on a dessert plate.

2. Scoop a generous ball of coconut ice cream next to the cake.

3. Sprinkle the toasted macadamia nuts over the ice cream and cake, and finish with chocolate shavings if desired.

4. Pair with a glass of Ramos Pinto Quinta do Bom Retiro 20 Year Tawny Port to enhance the flavors of this decadent dessert.

Enjoy this luxurious and indulgent dessert combination, perfect for a romantic dinner or special occasion!
