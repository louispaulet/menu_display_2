#### For the Shishito Peppers:

#### For the Sake-Glazed Eggplant:
- 2 medium eggplants, cut into 1/2-inch rounds
- 1/4 cup sake
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons mirin
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons ginger, minced
- Olive oil

#### For the Romesco Sauce:
- 2 roasted red bell peppers, peeled and sliced
- 1/4 cup blanched almonds
- 1/4 cup hazelnuts
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
- 1 slice stale bread, torn into pieces
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Preparing the Octopus:
1. **Clean and Tenderize:** Rinse the octopus thoroughly under cold water and remove the beak. In a large pot, bring water to a boil with the lemon halves, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and paprika. Submerge the octopus and simmer for 45 minutes to an hour, or until tender.
2. **Grill the Octopus:** Preheat your grill to medium-high. Remove the octopus from the water, pat dry with paper towels, and cut into manageable large pieces. Brush with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill for 3-4 minutes per side until charred and crisp.

#### Cooking the Shishito Peppers:
1. **Prepare the Peppers:** Toss the shishito peppers in olive oil and grill them alongside the octopus until blistered, about 2-3 minutes. Season with flaky sea salt.

#### Making the Sake-Glazed Eggplant:
1. **Prepare the Glaze:** In a small saucepan, combine the sake, soy sauce, mirin, honey, and ginger. Bring to a simmer and reduce slightly to thicken the sauce, about 5 minutes.
2. **Cook the Eggplant:** Heat some olive oil in a skillet and fry the eggplant rounds until golden brown on each side. Remove from heat and glaze with the prepared sake mixture.

#### Preparing the Romesco Sauce:
1. **Blend the Ingredients:** In a food processor, combine the roasted red peppers, almonds, hazelnuts, garlic, sherry vinegar, and bread. Pulse to combine. With the motor running, slowly add olive oil until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.

### Plating the Dish
1. **Assemble the Dish:** Arrange the grilled octopus and glazed eggplants on each plate. Scatter the blistered shishito peppers around.
2. **Sauce and Serve:** Drizzle with romesco sauce on the side or beneath the octopus. Garnish with lemon wedges and serve immediately.

### Wine Pairing
- **Suggested Wine:** Pair this dish with a **Verdejo Belondrade y Lurton 2018**, offering a crisp and aromatic backdrop that complements the smoky octopus and vibrant vegetables.
