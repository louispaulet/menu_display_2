## Ingredients

### Sorbet Base
- 2 cups fresh lime juice (about 16-18 limes)
- 1 ½ cups sugar
- 1 ½ cups water
- ¼ cup fresh mint leaves
- ½ cup white rum (optional for an authentic mojito flavor)

### Mint Sugar
- ½ cup sugar
- ¼ cup fresh mint leaves

### Assembly

## Instructions

### Prepare the Sorbet Base
1. **Make the Simple Syrup:**
   - In a small saucepan, combine the 1 ½ cups sugar with 1 ½ cups water.
   - Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is completely dissolved.
   - Allow to cool completely.

2. **Blend the Mint and Lime Juice:**
   - In a blender, combine the cooled simple syrup with the lime juice and ¼ cup fresh mint leaves.
   - Blend until the mint leaves are finely chopped and the mixture is well combined.

3. **Strain:**
   - Pour the mixture through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl to remove the mint solids.
   - Stir in the white rum (if using) to the mixture.

4. **Refrigerate:**
   - Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or until very cold.

### Make the Mint Sugar
1. **Process the Mint and Sugar:**
   - In a food processor, combine ½ cup sugar with ¼ cup fresh mint leaves.
   - Pulse until the mint is finely chopped and integrated with the sugar. The result should be a fragrant mint sugar.

### Freeze the Sorbet with Liquid Nitrogen
1. **Safety First:**
   - Wear protective gloves and goggles. Use liquid nitrogen in a well-ventilated area.

2. **Freeze the Sorbet:**
   - Pour the chilled sorbet mixture into a large stainless steel bowl.
   - Carefully pour liquid nitrogen over the mixture, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.
   - Continue adding liquid nitrogen and stirring until the sorbet reaches a smooth, creamy consistency.

3. **Store:**
   - Once the desired texture is achieved, immediately transfer the sorbet to a freeze-safe container and store it in the freezer until ready to serve.

### Assemble and Serve
1. **Scoop and Garnish:**
   - Scoop the sorbet into chilled bowls or glasses.
   - Sprinkle a generous amount of mint sugar over each serving.

2. **Presentation:**
   - For aesthetic appeal, garnish with a sprig of fresh mint on top of each sorbet serving.
