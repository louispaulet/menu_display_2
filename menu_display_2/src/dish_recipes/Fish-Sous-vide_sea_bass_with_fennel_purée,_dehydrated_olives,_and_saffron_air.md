### Instructions:

#### Dehydrated Olives:
1. Preheat your oven to 90°C (194°F).
2. Spread the olives on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
3. Place in the oven for 2-3 hours, until completely dry.
4. Once dry, blend into a fine powder using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle.

#### Fennel Purée:
1. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat and add the chopped fennel.
2. Cook until the fennel softens, about 10 minutes.
3. Add the chicken stock and reduce until the fennel is tender.
4. Pour in the cream and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for an additional 5 minutes.
5. Blend the mixture into a smooth purée using a blender or immersion blender.
6. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
7. Keep warm until serving.

#### Sous-vide Sea Bass:
1. Preheat sous-vide water bath to 54°C (129°F).
2. Season the sea bass fillets with salt and pepper.
3. Place each fillet into a vacuum-sealable bag along with a slice of lemon, a sprig of thyme, and a drizzle of olive oil.
4. Seal the bags using a vacuum sealer.
5. Submerge the sealed bags in the water bath and cook for 30 minutes.
6. After cooking, remove the fillets from the bags and pat dry.
7. To finish, quickly sear the fillets skin-side down in a hot pan for 1-2 minutes until the skin is crispy.
8. Rest the fish on a warm plate.

#### Saffron Air:
1. In a small saucepan, gently warm the water and add the saffron. Steep until the water takes on a rich saffron color.
2. Season with salt.
3. Pour the saffron water into a bowl and add the lecithin powder.
4. Use a hand blender to froth the mixture, creating light, saffron-scented air.

### Plating:
1. On a plate, spread a spoonful of fennel purée in a gentle arc.
2. Place the sea bass fillet over the purée, crispy skin side up.
3. Dust a line of dehydrated olive powder beside the purée.
4. Spoon the saffron air delicately over the fish and purée.
