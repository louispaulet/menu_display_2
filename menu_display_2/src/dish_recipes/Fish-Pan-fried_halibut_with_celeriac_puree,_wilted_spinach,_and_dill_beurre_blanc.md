## Instructions

### Celeriac Puree
1. **Cook the Celeriac:** Place diced celeriac into a pot of salted boiling water and cook until completely tender (15-20 minutes).

3. **Season:** Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm until ready to serve.

3. **Flavor and Season:** Stir in the chopped dill and lemon juice, season to taste with salt and pepper, and keep warm.

### Wilted Spinach
