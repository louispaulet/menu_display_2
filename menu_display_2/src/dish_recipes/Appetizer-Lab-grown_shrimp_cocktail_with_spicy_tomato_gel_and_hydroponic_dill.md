- 1 tablespoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon white pepper
- 2 cups ice water
- 1 lemon, sliced

### For the Spicy Tomato Gel:
- 300 grams ripe tomatoes, peeled and seeded

- 1 tablespoon chili paste (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons agar agar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- Salt to taste

### For Garnish:

## Instructions:

### Preparing the Shrimp:
1. **Marinate the Shrimp**: In a bowl, sprinkle shrimp with sea salt and white pepper. Let it marinate for 10 minutes.
2. **Cook the Shrimp**: In a pot of boiling water, add lemon slices. Blanch shrimp for 2-3 minutes until pink and opaque. Immediately transfer to an ice water bath to halt cooking.
3. **Drain and Chill**: Drain the shrimp and pat dry with paper towels. Keep chilled until serving.

### Making the Spicy Tomato Gel:
1. **Blend Ingredients**: In a blender, combine peeled tomatoes, tomato paste, chili paste, smoked paprika, honey, and lemon juice. Blend until smooth.
2. **Cook the Mixture**: Pour the mixture into a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir in agar agar and cook for 3-4 minutes, until mixture thickens slightly.
3. **Set the Gel**: Transfer mixture to a shallow dish and allow to set in the fridge for about 1 hour.
4. **Cut the Gel**: Once set, cut the gel into cubes or use a small circle cutter for uniform shapes.

### Assembling the Dish:
1. **Arrange Shrimp**: On a platter or individual dishes, elegantly arrange chilled shrimp.
2. **Add Tomato Gel**: Place the spicy tomato gel pieces neatly beside the shrimp.
3. **Garnish**: Add sprigs of fresh hydroponic dill and serve with lemon wedges on the side.

## Wine Pairing:
- **Lunar Valley Chardonnay 2049**: A perfect accompaniment with its bright citrus notes and subtle earthiness, complementing the oceanic sweetness of the shrimp and the fiery zest of the tomato gel.

## Serving Suggestion:
