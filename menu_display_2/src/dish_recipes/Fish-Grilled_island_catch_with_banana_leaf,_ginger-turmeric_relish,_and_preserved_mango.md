### Grilled Island Catch with Banana Leaf, Ginger-Turmeric Relish, and Preserved Mango

#### Ingredients:

**Fish and Marinade:**
- 4 fillets of local island fish (snapper, mahi-mahi, or grouper)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Juice of 1 lime
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 large banana leaves (or aluminum foil if unavailable)

**Ginger-Turmeric Relish:**
- 1/4 cup fresh ginger, finely grated
- 1 tablespoon turmeric, freshly grated or 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- Salt to taste

**Preserved Mango:**
- 1 ripe mango, diced
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon mustard seeds

#### Instructions:

1. **Fish Preparation:**
   - In a large bowl, combine olive oil, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Coat the fish fillets evenly and marinate for about 20 minutes while you prepare other components.

2. **Ginger-Turmeric Relish:**
   - In a small bowl, mix together grated ginger, turmeric, honey, rice vinegar, garlic, chili flakes, and cilantro. Season with salt. Set aside for flavors to meld.

3. **Preserved Mango:**
   - In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the diced mango, sugar, apple cider vinegar, salt, and mustard seeds. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the mango starts to soften and the mixture thickens slightly. Set aside to cool.

4. **Grilling the Fish:**
   - Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
   - Place each fillet on a banana leaf, folding leaves up to enclose the fish securely. If using foil, wrap the fish tightly.
   - Grill the wrapped fish for about 10 minutes per side, depending on thickness, until the fish flakes easily with a fork and is cooked through.

5. **Assembly:**
   - Gently unwrap the grilled fish and discard the banana leaves.
   - Serve fish on a platter or individual plates, topped with a generous spoonful of ginger-turmeric relish and a side of preserved mango.

#### Wine Pairing:
- **Sancerre Domaine Vacheron Belle Dame 2019**: The wine's minerality and citrus notes will complement the freshness of the fish while balancing the rich, tangy flavors of the relish and preserved mango.

Enjoy your delightful island catch experience, imbued with the exotic taste of traditional and well-balanced flavors.
