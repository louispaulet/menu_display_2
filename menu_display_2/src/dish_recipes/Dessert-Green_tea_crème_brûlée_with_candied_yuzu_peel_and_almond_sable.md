- **6 tbsp** granulated sugar (split into 4 tbsp and 2 tbsp)
- **2 tsp** high-quality matcha green tea powder
- **4** large egg yolks
- **1 tsp** vanilla extract
- **2 tbsp** granulated sugar, for caramelizing

### Candied Yuzu Peel:
- **2** yuzu fruits, peel only, cut into julienne strips
- **1 cup** granulated sugar
- **1 cup** water

### Almond Sablé:
- **1/2 cup** unsalted butter, softened
- **1/4 cup** powdered sugar
- **1/2 tsp** vanilla extract
- **1 cup** all-purpose flour
- **1/3 cup** finely ground blanched almonds
- **Pinch** of salt

## Directions:

### Green Tea Crème Brûlée:
1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C).
2. In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, 4 tbsp of sugar, and matcha powder. Stir continuously over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is hot but not boiling. Remove from heat.
3. In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and remaining 2 tbsp sugar until pale and thick.
4. Gradually add the hot cream mixture to the yolks, whisking continuously to temper the eggs.
5. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a large jug and stir in the vanilla extract.
6. Divide the mixture among 4 ramekins (4-oz each).
7. Place the ramekins in a deep baking dish and pour hot water into the dish until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
8. Bake for 35-40 minutes until the edges are set and the center still wobbles slightly.
9. Remove from the water bath, cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until completely chilled.
10. Just before serving, sprinkle 2 tbsp of sugar evenly over the surface of each custard. Caramelize using a kitchen torch until the sugar is melted and forms a crispy top.

### Candied Yuzu Peel:
1. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water, bringing it to a boil to dissolve the sugar, creating a simple syrup.
2. Add the yuzu peel strips and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for about 20 minutes until the yuzu is translucent.
3. Remove the peel from the syrup and let them dry on a wire rack. Coat them lightly in sugar if desired.

### Almond Sablé:
1. In a medium bowl, beat the butter until creamy. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla, beating until smooth.
2. Incorporate the flour, ground almonds, and salt, mixing until a dough forms.
3. Roll the dough into a log shape, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
4. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
5. Slice the chilled dough into 1/4-inch thick rounds and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
6. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the edges are golden brown.
7. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack.

## Assembly:

1. Serve each chilled crème brûlée on a plate.
2. Garnish with candied yuzu peel on top of the caramelized surface.
3. Add a couple of almond sablé cookies on the side.
4. Pair with a glass of Sauternes Château Rieussec 2017 to complement the dessert.

Enjoy this sophisticated and elegant dessert, with the earthy notes of matcha, the zest of yuzu, and the richness of almonds perfectly balanced with a sweet Sauternes wine.
