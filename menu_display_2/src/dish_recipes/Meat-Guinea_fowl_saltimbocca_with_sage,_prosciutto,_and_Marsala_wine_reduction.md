### Guinea Fowl Saltimbocca with Sage, Prosciutto, and Marsala Wine Reduction

#### Ingredients:

- 4 guinea fowl breasts
- 8 thin slices of prosciutto
- 12 fresh sage leaves
- 1/2 cup Marsala wine
- 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- Toothpicks or kitchen string

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Guinea Fowl Breasts:**
   - Begin by placing a guinea fowl breast between two sheets of plastic wrap. Pound gently with a meat mallet until it is uniformly thin, about a half-inch thick.
   - Repeat with the remaining breasts.
   - Season each piece lightly with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

2. **Assemble the Saltimbocca:**
   - Lay 2 sage leaves on each breast.
   - Cover with 2 slices of prosciutto, pressing down so they adhere neatly to the meat.
   - Secure each breast with toothpicks or tie gently with kitchen string.

3. **Cooking the Saltimbocca:**
   - Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
   - When the butter stops foaming, add the guinea fowl, prosciutto side down, and cook for about 4 minutes, until the prosciutto is crisp and golden.
   - Flip the breasts and cook the other side for an additional 3-4 minutes until cooked through.
   - Transfer the guinea fowl to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.

4. **Make the Marsala Wine Reduction:**
   - To the same skillet, add the Marsala wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
   - Let the wine simmer and reduce by half, about 3-4 minutes.
   - Add the chicken stock and continue to simmer until slightly thickened, around 5 minutes more.
   - Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter until the sauce is smooth and glossy.

5. **Serve:**
   - Remove toothpicks or string from the guinea fowl.
   - Plate the saltimbocca and drizzle generously with the Marsala reduction.
   - Garnish with extra sage leaves if desired, and serve immediately.

#### Wine Pairing:

- Enjoy this dish with a Chianti Classico Fontodi 2018, whose balanced tannins and vibrant fruitiness complement the savory elements of the saltimbocca perfectly.
