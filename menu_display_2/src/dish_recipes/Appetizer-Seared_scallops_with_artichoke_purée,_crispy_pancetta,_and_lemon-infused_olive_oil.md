### Artichoke Purée
- 8-10 baby artichokes, cleaned and quartered
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 cup vegetable or chicken stock
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

### Crispy Pancetta
- 8 slices pancetta, thinly sliced

### Lemon-Infused Olive Oil
- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Zest of 1 lemon
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- Pinch of salt

### Garnish

## Instructions

### Prepare Lemon-Infused Olive Oil
1. In a small bowl, combine extra-virgin olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt.
2. Mix well and let it infuse for at least 30 minutes.

### Make Artichoke Purée
1. In a saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, and sauté until translucent.
2. Add the artichoke quarters and sauté for another 5 minutes.
3. Pour in the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the artichokes are very tender, about 20 minutes.
4. Blend the mixture into a smooth purée using a hand blender or food processor. Add heavy cream and blend until fully incorporated.
5. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Keep warm until serving.

### Cook Crispy Pancetta
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Lay pancetta slices in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
3. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until crispy.
4. Remove from oven and drain on paper towels. Break into small pieces.

### Sear the Scallops
1. Pat the scallops dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper.
2. In a large skillet, heat butter and olive oil over high heat until the butter is melted and foamy.
3. Carefully add scallops to the skillet in a single layer without overcrowding.
4. Sear the scallops for about 1.5-2 minutes per side, or until a golden brown crust forms and the scallops are opaque in the center.

### Assemble the Dish
1. On each plate, create a bed of artichoke purée.
2. Arrange 3 scallops on top of the purée.
3. Sprinkle crispy pancetta pieces over the scallops.
4. Drizzle with lemon-infused olive oil.
5. Garnish with fresh parsley and a touch of lemon zest.
