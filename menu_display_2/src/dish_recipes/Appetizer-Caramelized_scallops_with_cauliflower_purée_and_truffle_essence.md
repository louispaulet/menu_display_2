## Caramelized Scallops with Cauliflower Purée and Truffle Essence

### Ingredients

#### For the Scallops:
- 12 large sea scallops, fresh and dry
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Fresh chives, finely chopped (for garnish)

#### For the Cauliflower Purée:
- 1 medium head of cauliflower, chopped into florets
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

#### For the Truffle Essence:
- 1 tablespoon truffle oil
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice

### Instructions

#### For the Cauliflower Purée:
1. **Prep the Cauliflower**: Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the cauliflower florets and cook until tender, about 8-10 minutes.
2. **Blend**: Drain the cauliflower and transfer to a food processor. Add butter and heavy cream. Blend until smooth.
3. **Season**: Season the purée with salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm until serving.

#### For the Truffle Essence:
1. **Mix Ingredients**: In a small bowl, mix truffle oil with lemon juice. Set aside.

#### For the Scallops:
1. **Prepare Scallops**: Pat the scallops dry with a paper towel. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
2. **Sear Scallops**: In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add butter and let it melt and bubble. Place scallops in the skillet, cooking in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding.
3. **Caramelize**: Cook scallops approximately 2-3 minutes per side, or until you achieve a golden brown caramelization and the scallops are just opaque in the center.

### To Serve:
1. **Plate**: Spoon cauliflower purée onto the center of each serving plate.
2. **Arrange**: Arrange three scallops on top of the purée.
3. **Finish**: Drizzle truffle essence lightly over the scallops and purée.
4. **Garnish**: Finish with a sprinkle of finely chopped chives.

### Wine Pairing:
- Serve with a glass of Sancerre Domaine Vacheron 2020 to complement the flavors of the dish.
