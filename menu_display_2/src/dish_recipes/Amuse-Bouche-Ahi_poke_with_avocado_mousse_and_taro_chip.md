### Ahi Poke with Avocado Mousse and Taro Chip

#### Ingredients

**For the Ahi Poke:**
- 300g sushi-grade Ahi tuna, diced into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped green onion
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped cilantro

**For the Avocado Mousse:**
- 2 ripe avocados, peeled and pitted
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 1 tablespoon sour cream
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the Taro Chips:**
- 1 large taro root, peeled and thinly sliced
- Vegetable oil for frying
- Salt to taste

#### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Ahi Poke:**  
   - In a medium bowl, combine the diced Ahi tuna, soy sauce, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, green onion, sesame seeds, and cilantro. Toss gently to avoid breaking up the tuna. Cover and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

2. **Make the Avocado Mousse:**  
   - In a food processor, blend the avocados, lime juice, and sour cream until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the mousse to a piping bag fitted with a star tip or a simple cut tip for a more rustic look.

3. **Fry the Taro Chips:**  
   - In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat the vegetable oil to 350°F (175°C). Carefully add the sliced taro chips in batches and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season with a pinch of salt while still warm.

4. **Assemble the Amuse-Bouche:**  
   - On a small serving plate or spoon, pipe a dollop of avocado mousse. Gently place a small mound of Ahi poke over the mousse. Garnish with additional green onion or sesame seeds if desired.
   - Serve each assembled canapé with a freshly fried taro chip on the side.

#### Suggested Wine Pairing
- Serve with a chilled glass of Rosé Domaine Tempier Bandol 2020. The wine’s bright acidity and hints of citrus and red berries complement the richness of the avocado and the savory, slightly spicy elements of the poke.
