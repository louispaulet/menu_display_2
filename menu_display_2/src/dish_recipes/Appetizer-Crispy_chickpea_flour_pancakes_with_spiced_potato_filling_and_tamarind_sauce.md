### Instructions

#### Preparing the Tamarind Sauce
1. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine tamarind paste, jaggery, roasted cumin powder, and red chili powder.
2. Add water and bring to a boil. Lower heat and allow it to simmer for 10-15 minutes until thickened, stirring occasionally.
3. Adjust sugar and salt as per taste. Once done, set aside to cool.

#### Preparing the Potato Filling
1. In a pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and let them crackle.
2. Add cumin seeds and allow them to sizzle.
3. Add chopped onions and green chili, sautéing until the onions turn translucent.
4. Stir in the turmeric powder and mix well.
5. Add the mashed potatoes, sprinkle with salt, and stir to combine.
6. Cook for 3-4 minutes, then add garam masala, cilantro, and lemon juice. Mix well, adjust salt if needed, and set aside.

#### Preparing the Chickpea Pancakes
1. In a mixing bowl, combine chickpea flour, turmeric, red chili powder, salt, and cumin seeds.
2. Gradually add water, mixing until you have a smooth and pourable batter. Stir in chopped cilantro.
3. Heat a non-stick skillet on medium heat. Lightly grease the skillet with oil.
4. Pour a ladle of batter onto the skillet, spreading it into a thin circle.
5. Cook until bubbles form on the top surface and edges lift, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until golden and crispy.
6. Repeat with remaining batter, adding oil as needed.

#### Assembling the Dish
1. Place a spoonful of spiced potato filling onto one half of a pancake.
2. Drizzle with prepared tamarind sauce.
3. Fold the pancake over the filling, forming a half-moon shape.
4. Serve immediately with additional tamarind sauce on the side.

**Tips:**
- Adjust the consistency of the pancake batter by adding more water if necessary—the batter should be thin but spread well.
- Experiment with adding sweet or spicy elements to the tamarind sauce to match personal taste.
