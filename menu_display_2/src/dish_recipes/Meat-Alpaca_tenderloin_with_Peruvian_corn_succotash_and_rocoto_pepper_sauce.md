### Alpaca Tenderloin with Peruvian Corn Succotash and Rocoto Pepper Sauce

#### Ingredients:

**For the Alpaca Tenderloin:**
- 4 Alpaca tenderloin steaks (about 6 oz each)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 sprig fresh thyme
- 1 clove garlic, crushed

**For the Peruvian Corn Succotash:**
- 1 cup Peruvian giant corn kernels (choclo)
- 1/2 cup cooked fava beans (peeled)
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 small zucchini, diced
- 1/2 red onion, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

**For the Rocoto Pepper Sauce:**
- 2 tablespoons rocoto paste or fresh rocoto peppers (seeded and chopped)
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon butter
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

#### Instructions:

**1. Prepare the Rocoto Pepper Sauce:**
   - In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the rocoto paste and cook for 2-3 minutes.
   - Slowly whisk in the heavy cream and reduce the heat to low, allowing the sauce to simmer until slightly thickened, about 5-7 minutes.
   - Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Keep warm until serving.

**2. Make the Corn Succotash:**
   - Heat olive oil in a medium-sized skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and bell pepper, saut√© until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
   - Add the corn kernels, fava beans, and zucchini, and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 7-8 minutes. 
   - Season with salt and pepper, then stir in the chopped cilantro. Remove from heat and set aside.

**3. Cook the Alpaca Tenderloin:**
   - Season the alpaca steaks with salt and black pepper on both sides.
   - Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the steaks and sear for 2-3 minutes on each side for medium-rare, depending on thickness.
   - Reduce heat to medium, add butter, thyme, and garlic to the skillet. Use a spoon to baste the steaks with the melted butter for an additional minute or two until cooked to your desired doneness.
   - Remove from the skillet and allow the steaks to rest for 5 minutes before serving.

**4. Assemble the Dish:**
   - Spoon a generous portion of the corn succotash onto the center of each plate. Place the alpaca tenderloin on top or to the side, as preferred.
   - Drizzle the rocoto pepper sauce around the plate or over the top of the tenderloin for an added touch of flavor.
   - Serve immediately, pairing with a glass of Enrique Foster Reserva Malbec 2018, to complement the rich flavors of the dish.

Enjoy your refined and vibrant Peruvian-inspired meal!
