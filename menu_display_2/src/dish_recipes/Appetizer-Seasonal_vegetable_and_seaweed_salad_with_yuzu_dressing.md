#### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Vegetables and Seaweed:**
   - Thinly slice the seasonal vegetables using a mandolin or sharp knife for uniform pieces.
   - If using Wakame or Arame seaweed, soak in warm water for about 5 minutes until rehydrated and tender. Drain well.

2. **Make the Yuzu Dressing:**
   - In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the yuzu juice, rice vinegar, soy sauce, mirin, honey, and grated ginger until well combined.
   - Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while continuing to whisk, creating a smooth, emulsified dressing.
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste, adjusting acidity with more yuzu juice if necessary.

3. **Assemble the Salad:**
   - In a large bowl, gently toss the mixed seasonal vegetables and rehydrated seaweed with several tablespoons of the yuzu dressing.
   - Arrange the dressed vegetables and seaweed artfully on a serving platter.
   - Garnish with sesame seeds, microgreens, and pickled ginger.

4. **Serve:**
   - Serve immediately to enjoy the fresh, crisp textures and vibrant flavors.
   - Pair with a chilled glass of Dassai 23 Junmai Daiginjo to enhance the aromatic notes of yuzu and the umami-rich seaweed.

#### Tips:
- Use a mix of colorful vegetables to add visual appeal to the salad.
- Adjust seasoning of the dressing based on the sourness of the yuzu juice available.
- Chill the salad for about 10 minutes before serving for a more refreshing taste.
