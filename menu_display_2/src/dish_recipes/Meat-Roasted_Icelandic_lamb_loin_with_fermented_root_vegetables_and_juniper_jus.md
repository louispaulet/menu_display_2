- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

#### For the Fermented Root Vegetables:

- 200g parsnips, peeled and cut into batons
- 200g celeriac, peeled and cut into batons
- 500ml filtered water
- 1 tablespoon sea salt

#### For the Juniper Jus:
- 500ml veal stock
- 100ml red wine
- 1 tablespoon juniper berries
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Instructions

#### Fermenting the Root Vegetables:
1. Dissolve the sea salt in filtered water. Stir in the apple cider vinegar.
2. Place the root vegetables in a clean jar or fermenting crock, layering with the juniper berries and bay leaves.
3. Pour the brine over the vegetables, ensuring they are completely submerged.
4. Cover the jar with a loosely fitting lid or cloth and let ferment at room temperature for 3-5 days, until tangy and slightly effervescent.

#### Preparing the Lamb Loin:
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F).
2. In a small bowl, combine olive oil, minced garlic, thyme, and rosemary.
3. Season the lamb loin generously with salt and pepper, then rub the herb mixture onto the meat.
4. Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat and sear the lamb loin on all sides until golden brown.
5. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until the internal temperature reaches 57°C (135°F) for medium-rare, about 15-20 minutes.
6. Remove from oven and let rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing.

#### Making the Juniper Jus:
1. In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, sautéing until translucent.
2. Add the red wine and juniper berries, allowing to reduce by half.
3. Stir in the veal stock and simmer until the sauce coats the back of a spoon, about 15-20 minutes.
4. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then strain the jus through a fine mesh sieve.

### Plating
1. Thinly slice the rested lamb loin and place on a serving platter.
2. Arrange the fermented root vegetables artistically around the lamb.
3. Drizzle the juniper jus over the lamb slices and around the plate.
4. Serve hot with a glass of Pinot Noir Domaine Drouhin Oregon Dundee Hills 2017 to complement the dish's flavors.

Enjoy your gourmet Icelandic lamb loin with the perfect balance of fermentation and the aromatic kiss of juniper! 🍷🍖
