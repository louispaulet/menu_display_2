### Preparing the Vegetables

### Making the Yuzu Miso Dressing
1. In a small bowl, combine white miso paste, yuzu juice, mirin, sake, sugar, and grated ginger.
2. Stir well until smooth. Adjust seasoning to taste.

### Assembly
1. Arrange the blanched Kyoto vegetables and tofu cubes artistically on a serving plate.
2. Drizzle the yuzu miso dressing generously over the top.
