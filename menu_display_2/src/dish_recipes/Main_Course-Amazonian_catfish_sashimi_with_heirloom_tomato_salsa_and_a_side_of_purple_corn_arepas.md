## Instructions

### Preparing the Catfish Sashimi:
1. **Marinade:** In a small bowl, mix soy sauce, sushi vinegar, mirin, lime juice, fresh ginger, and citrus zest. Set aside.

2. **Slice the Catfish:** Using a sharp knife, slice the catfish fillet into thin sashimi slices, about 1/4-inch thick.

3. **Marinate:** Lay the slices in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over. Cover and let it marinate in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.

### Making the Heirloom Tomato Salsa:
1. **Mix Ingredients:** In a mixing bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, red onion, jalapeño, lime juice, and olive oil.

2. **Season:** Add the cilantro, salt, and pepper to taste. Mix gently to combine.

3. **Chill:** Let the salsa chill in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes before serving to let the flavors meld.

### Preparing the Purple Corn Arepas:
1. **Mix Dough:** In a medium bowl, combine purple corn flour and salt. Gradually add warm water, mixing until a dough forms.

2. **Knead:** Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead in the melted butter until smooth, about 5 minutes.

3. **Shape:** Divide the dough into equal portions, roll each into a ball, and flatten into disks about 1/2-inch thick.

4. **Cook:** Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook arepas for 5 minutes on each side or until they are crispy on the outside and cooked through. Keep them warm.

## Plating
1. **Sashimi Arrangement:** On a flat serving plate, arrange the catfish sashimi slices in a fan shape.

2. **Garnish:** Sprinkle with black sesame seeds and a sprinkle of sea salt. Top with chopped cilantro.

3. **Serve:** Serve with a side of heirloom tomato salsa and warm purple corn arepas.

4. **Pair:** Enjoy this dish paired with a glass of Chenin Blanc François Chidaine Montlouis-sur-Loire Les Bournais 2016.
