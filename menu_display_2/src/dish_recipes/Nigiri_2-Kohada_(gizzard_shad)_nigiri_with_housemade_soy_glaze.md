## Kohada (Gizzard Shad) Nigiri with Housemade Soy Glaze

### Ingredients:

#### Sushi Rice:
- 1 cup sushi rice
- 1 1/4 cups water
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

#### Gizzard Shad:
- 8 fresh kohada filets (gizzard shad), boneless and scales removed
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1/2 cup rice vinegar

#### Soy Glaze:
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup mirin
- 2 tablespoons sugar

### Instructions:

#### Preparing the Sushi Rice:
1. Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch.
2. In a rice cooker (or pot), combine the rinsed rice and 1 1/4 cups water. Cook according to the rice cooker's instructions or bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes if using a pot.
3. While the rice is cooking, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl until the sugar dissolves.
4. Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a wide bowl (preferably wooden) and gently fold in the vinegar mixture using a spatula. Fan the rice as you mix to cool it down. 

#### Preparing the Gizzard Shad:
1. Lay the kohada fillets on a tray and sprinkle with salt. Let them sit for 30 minutes to draw out excess moisture.
2. Rinse the fillets under cold water to remove the salt, then place them in a shallow dish.
3. Pour rice vinegar over the fillets and let them marinate for 20 minutes. Remove and pat dry with a paper towel.

#### Housemade Soy Glaze:
1. In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, mirin, and sugar.
2. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring continuously until the sugar is dissolved. Continue to cook until the mixture reduces by half and forms a glaze-like consistency.
3. Remove from heat and let it cool.

#### Assembling the Nigiri:
1. Wet your hands with water and a bit of rice vinegar to prevent sticking.
2. Take a small amount of sushi rice and compress it gently in your hand to form an oval shape.
3. Place a fillet of kohada over the rice, gently pressing so it holds together.
4. Brush a thin layer of soy glaze over the kohada.
5. Serve immediately with the suggested wine pairing, Kubota Senju Ginjo, for an enhanced culinary experience.

### Wine Pairing:
- **Kubota Senju Ginjo**: This sake offers a refined balance of elegant sweetness and dryness, complementing the rich umami and slight sweetness of the soy glaze and the subtle flavors of the kohada nigiri.
