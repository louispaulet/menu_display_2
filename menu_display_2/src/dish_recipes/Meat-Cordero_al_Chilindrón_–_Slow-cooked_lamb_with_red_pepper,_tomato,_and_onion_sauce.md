# Cordero al Chilindrón

### Ingredients:

- **Lamb:**
  - 1.5 kg lamb shoulder or leg, cut into large chunks
  - Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
  - 3 tablespoons olive oil

- **Veggies & Aromatics:**
  - 2 large onions, sliced
  - 2 red bell peppers, cored, seeded, and thinly sliced
  - 4 cloves garlic, minced

- **Sauce Ingredients:**
  - 200 ml dry white wine
  - 2 cups (500g) of canned chopped tomatoes
  - 1 tablespoon sweet paprika
  - 1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)
  - 2 bay leaves
  - 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
  - 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
  - 1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance tomatoes)
  - 150 ml chicken or lamb stock

- **Herb Garnish:**
  - Handful fresh parsley, chopped

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Lamb:**
   - Season the lamb chunks generously with salt and pepper.
   - Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-based pan over medium-high heat. Brown the lamb on all sides in batches to avoid overcrowding. Transfer lamb to a plate and set aside.

2. **Cook the Vegetables:**
   - In the same pan with leftover lamb drippings, reduce the heat to medium. Add a bit more olive oil if necessary.
   - Add onions and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
   - Stir in the red pepper slices and cook until tender, about 5 more minutes.
   - Add the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

3. **Build the Sauce:**
   - Pour in the white wine, scraping any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Allow it to simmer for 2 minutes.
   - Add in the chopped tomatoes, both types of paprika, bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, sugar, and stock.

4. **Combine and Simmer:**
   - Return the browned lamb to the pan, making sure all pieces are submerged under the sauce.
   - Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours or until the lamb is tender and the sauce has thickened.
   - Stir occasionally, and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.

5. **Finish and Serve:**
   - Discard bay leaves before serving.
   - Garnish with a generous amount of chopped parsley.

6. **Wine Pairing:**
   - Serve hot with crusty bread or mashed potatoes for soaking up the delicious sauce. Pair with a glass of Rioja Marqués de Riscal Reserva 2015 to complement the rich flavors of the dish.
