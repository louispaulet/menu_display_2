# Pan-Seared Duck Liver with Apple Compote, Brioche, and Aged Balsamic

## Ingredients

### For the Duck Liver:
- 4 slices of fresh duck liver (approximately 50g each)
- Salt to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

### For the Apple Compote:
- 2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and cut into small cubes
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- A pinch of salt

### Additional Components:
- 4 slices of brioche bread
- 1 tablespoon aged balsamic vinegar
- Fresh microgreens for garnish

## Instructions

### Prepare the Apple Compote:
1. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the apple cubes and cook them gently until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the brown sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Stir to combine and allow the apples to cook until they are tender and the mixture is slightly thickened, about 10 more minutes.
3. Once done, set the compote aside to cool slightly.

### Prepare the Brioche:
1. Toast the brioche slices lightly under a broiler or in a toaster until golden brown. Set aside.

### Pan-Sear the Duck Liver:
1. Season the duck liver slices well with salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides.
2. Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.
3. Add the butter to the skillet. Once melted and foamy, carefully place the duck liver slices in the pan.
4. Sear the liver for about 1-2 minutes on each side until they are browned to your liking and have a crispy exterior while remaining slightly pink in the center.
5. Remove the liver from the pan and let it drain on paper towels briefly.

### Assembly:
1. Place each toasted brioche slice on individual serving plates.
2. Spoon a generous portion of apple compote onto the brioche.
3. Gently place the seared duck liver atop the compote, allowing the juices to amalgamate slightly.
4. Drizzle a touch of aged balsamic vinegar around and over the duck liver and entire dish.
5. Garnish with fresh microgreens to add a touch of earthiness and color to the dish.

### Wine Pairing:
- **Donnhoff Oberh√§user Leistenberg Riesling Kabinett 2019**: This exquisite Riesling with its mild sweetness and fresh acidity complements the rich duck liver and balances the sweetness of the apple compote beautifully.

## Notes
- Ensure the pan is sufficiently hot before adding the duck liver to achieve a perfect sear.
- The Riesling's character should play off nicely against the richness of this appetizer, bringing a refreshing contrast to each bite.

Enjoy your refined appetizer that is both elegant and sumptuous, evoking the harmony of sweet and savory flavors with each component delicately balanced.
