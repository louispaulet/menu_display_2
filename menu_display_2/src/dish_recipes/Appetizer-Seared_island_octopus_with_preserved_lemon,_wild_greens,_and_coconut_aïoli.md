## Seared Island Octopus with Preserved Lemon, Wild Greens, and Coconut Aïoli

### Ingredients:

#### Octopus:
- 1 whole fresh octopus (about 2-3 pounds)
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 bay leaves
- ½ cup white wine
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

#### Preserved Lemon:
- 2 lemons
- 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt
- 1 small cinnamon stick
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
- Extra virgin olive oil

#### Coconut Aïoli:
- ½ cup coconut cream
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- Salt to taste

#### Wild Greens:
- 2 cups assorted wild greens (such as purslane, dandelion greens, and mizuna)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Sea salt, to taste

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Preparing the Octopus
1. **Clean the Octopus:** Rinse and clean the octopus thoroughly under cold water. Remove the beak and eyes, then carefully cut the head from the tentacles.
2. **Simmer:** In a large pot, combine octopus, lemon slices, crushed garlic, bay leaves, and white wine. Add enough water to cover the octopus. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until tender.
3. **Rest:** Once tender, remove from heat and allow the octopus to cool in the cooking liquid for about 30 minutes. This helps it retain moisture.

#### Step 2: Preserving the Lemons
1. **Prepare:** Wash and dry lemons thoroughly. Cut each into quarters, but don’t cut all the way through, keeping them attached at the base.
2. **Salt and Spice:** Stuff each lemon with coarse sea salt, place them into a sterilized jar, and tuck in the cinnamon stick, bay leaves, and peppercorns. Press the lemons tightly together, ensuring the juice is released to cover them.
3. **Preserve:** Fill the jar with olive oil to fully submerge the lemons. Seal tightly and store in a dark, cool spot for at least 3 weeks before use, shaking the jar occasionally.

#### Step 3: Coconut Aïoli
1. **Blend:** In a mixing bowl, combine coconut cream, lime juice, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, and salt. Use an immersion blender (or mix well by hand) until smooth and emulsified. Adjust seasoning if necessary.

#### Step 4: Saute and Sear
1. **Saute Wild Greens:** Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the wild greens and season with sea salt. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until just wilted. Remove and set aside.
2. **Sear Octopus:** Once the octopus is rested and firm, cut the tentacles individually. Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add the tentacles and sear for 2-3 minutes on each side, until charred and crispy.

#### Step 5: Assemble the Dish
1. **Presentation:** On a serving plate, arrange a bed of sautéed wild greens. Place seared octopus tentacles over the greens.
2. **Dress:** Drizzle the dish with coconut aïoli and garnish with thin slices of preserved lemon.

#### Wine Pairing:
- **Served with:** Chablis 1er Cru Domaine William Fèvre Montée de Tonnerre 2018, a wonderful complement with its bright acidity and mineral notes, enhancing the diverse flavors of the dish.

### Tips:
- **For Tender Octopus:** Ensure slow and even cooking, and let it cool in its liquid to prevent the octopus from becoming chewy or tough.
- **Preserved Lemons:** These add a tangy burst, enhancing the freshness and depth of the dish, and are a delightful addition in various recipes once ready.

Enjoy this exquisite appetizer that beautifully combines earth and sea with vibrant flavor notes!
