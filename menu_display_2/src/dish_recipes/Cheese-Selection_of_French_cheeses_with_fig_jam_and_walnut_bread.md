### Ingredients

#### For the Cheese Platter:
- 100g Brie de Meaux
- 100g Roquefort
- 100g Comté
- 100g Chèvre (goat cheese)
- 100g Camembert

#### For the Fig Jam:
- 500g fresh figs, stemmed and quartered
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 lemon, juiced and zested
- 1 cinnamon stick

#### For the Walnut Bread:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
- 1 1/2 cups buttermilk

### Instructions

#### Making the Fig Jam:
1. In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the figs, sugar, honey, lemon juice and zest, and cinnamon stick.
2. Stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves, then reduce heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally until the figs have broken down and the mixture has thickened.
3. Remove the cinnamon stick and let the jam cool slightly before transferring to sterilized jar. Seal tightly and store in the refrigerator.

#### Baking the Walnut Bread:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lightly grease a loaf pan with butter.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, sugar, and salt.
3. Stir in the chopped walnuts.
4. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the buttermilk. Stir gently with a wooden spoon until just combined.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
7. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

#### Assembling the Cheese Platter:
1. Select a large, decorative platter or wooden board.
2. Arrange the cheeses evenly across the platter, allowing space for each to be cut and served individually.
3. Garnish with small bowls or dollops of fig jam around the selection.
4. Slice the walnut bread into thin, manageable slices and arrange them alongside the cheeses and jam.
5. Serve immediately with wine to enjoy at its best.

### Wine Pairing
Serve with a well-chilled bottle of **Gevrey-Chambertin Domaine Fourrier Vieilles Vignes 2017**. Its balanced tannins and fruity notes will enhance the flavors of the cheeses and provide a delightful finish to the cheese course.

### Chef’s Tips
- **Cheese Serving Temperature**: Always serve cheese at room temperature to allow the flavors to fully blossom.
- **Jam Consistency**: If you prefer a smoother jam, mash the figs slightly towards the end of cooking or blend briefly.
- **Bread Variations**: Add dried fruits like raisins or cranberries for an extra dimension to your walnut bread.
