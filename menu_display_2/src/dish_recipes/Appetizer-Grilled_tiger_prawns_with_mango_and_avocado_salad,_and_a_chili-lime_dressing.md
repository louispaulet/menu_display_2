## Instructions:

### Preparing the Tiger Prawns:
1. **Marinate the prawns**: In a bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Add the tiger prawns and toss to coat evenly. Let them marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

2. **Grill the prawns**: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Place the prawns on the grill and cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side or until they are opaque and slightly charred.

### Preparing the Mango and Avocado Salad:
1. In a large bowl, combine the diced mango, avocado, red onion, red bell pepper, and cilantro.

2. **Make the dressing**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the lime juice, olive oil, honey, chopped chili, salt, and pepper.

3. **Dress the salad**: Pour the chili-lime dressing over the mango and avocado mixture. Toss gently to combine, ensuring the salad is well-coated.

### Plating:
1. Arrange a portion of the mango and avocado salad in the center of each serving plate.

2. Layer the grilled tiger prawns on top of the salad.

3. Garnish with additional fresh cilantro leaves and a lime wedge.

4. Serve immediately, paired with a chilled glass of Mulderbosch Chenin Blanc 2019.
