## Ingredients

### For the Cod:
- 4 cod fillets, skin on (about 150g each)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### For the Seaweed and Leeks:
- 200g fresh foraged seaweed (such as sea lettuce or dulse)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 medium leeks, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 50ml white wine
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### For the Mussel Emulsion:
- 500g fresh mussels, cleaned and debearded
- 200ml fish stock
- 50ml white wine
- 1 small shallot, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, sliced
- 100ml heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- Fresh lemon juice to finish

## Instructions

### Prepare the Mussel Emulsion:
1. In a large saucepan, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic, and cook until soft and translucent.
2. Increase the heat to high, add the mussels, fish stock, and white wine. Cover and cook for 3-5 minutes until the mussels open. Discard any that remain closed.
3. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve, reserving the broth. Remove the mussels from their shells and set aside.
4. In a clean saucepan, combine the mussel broth and cream. Bring to a gentle simmer and reduce by half.
5. Whisk in the butter until the emulsion is smooth and slightly thickened. Season with salt, pepper, and a splash of lemon juice. Keep warm.

### Prepare the Seaweed and Leeks:
6. Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the leeks and cook gently until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
7. Stir in garlic and cook for an additional minute. Add the white wine and allow it to evaporate.
8. Fold in the fresh seaweed and season with salt and pepper. Cook just until the seaweed is tender, about 3 minutes. Set aside.

### Cook the Cod:
9. Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F).
10. Pat the cod fillets dry with a paper towel. Season with salt and pepper.
11. Heat olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Place the cod fillets skin side down, cooking until the skin is crispy, about 3 minutes.
12. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven to finish cooking the cod for 4-6 minutes, depending on thickness.

## To Serve
13. Plate a portion of the leek and seaweed mixture on each plate.
14. Gently place the cod fillet on top of the vegetables.
15. Spoon the mussel emulsion around the plate edge, placing a few of the reserved mussels on each plate.
16. Serve immediately with a glass of Chenin Blanc François Chidaine Montlouis-sur-Loire Les Choisilles 2019.
