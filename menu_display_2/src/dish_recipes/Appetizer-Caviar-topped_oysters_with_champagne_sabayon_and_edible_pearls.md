### Champagne Sabayon
- 3 large egg yolks
- 1/4 cup (60ml) Champagne
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) lemon juice

### Toppings
- 2 ounces (56g) high-quality caviar (Beluga or Osetra)
- Edible pearls (store-bought or homemade)*

## Instructions

### Preparation
1. **Prepare Oysters:**
   - Gently shuck the oysters, retaining the liquid within the shells.
   - Place the opened oysters on a bed of crushed ice to keep them cool and fresh until ready to serve.

2. **Make Champagne Sabayon:**
   - In a heatproof bowl, whisk together egg yolks, champagne, lemon juice, and sugar until well combined.
   - Place the bowl over a pot of gently simmering water, ensuring the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water.
   - Whisk vigorously until the mixture becomes frothy and starts to thicken, about 5-7 minutes.
   - Season with a pinch of salt and continue whisking until the sabayon is light and airy.
   - Remove from heat and set aside.

3. **Assemble the Oysters:**
   - Carefully spoon a small amount of the champagne sabayon onto each oyster, taking care not to overwhelm the natural flavor of the oyster.
   - Top each one with a few pearls of caviar.
   - Place a few edible pearls on top for added texture and visual appeal.

4. **Garnish and Serve:**
   - Sprinkle a few finely chopped chives over each oyster.
   - Serve immediately, paired with a glass of Krug Clos du Mesnil Blanc de Blancsâ€”2013.

## Notes
- **Edible Pearls:** These can be purchased from specialty food stores or made at home using culinary techniques (such as spherification) if preferred.
- For best results, always use the freshest oysters available and handle them with care to preserve their pristine flavor and texture.
