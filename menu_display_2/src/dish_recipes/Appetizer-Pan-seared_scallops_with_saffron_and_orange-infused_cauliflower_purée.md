## Pan-seared Scallops with Saffron and Orange-infused Cauliflower Purée

### Ingredients

#### For the Scallops
- 12 large sea scallops, patted dry
- Salt and freshly ground white pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Zest of 1 orange
- Fresh chervil leaves, for garnish

#### For the Cauliflower Purée
- 1 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 teaspoon saffron threads
- Zest and juice of 1 orange
- Salt and freshly ground white pepper, to taste

### Instructions

#### Cauliflower Purée
1. **Infuse the Saffron:**
   - Combine the heavy cream and saffron in a small saucepan. Warm gently over low heat for 5 minutes, ensuring it doesn’t boil. Remove from heat and let the saffron steep.
   
2. **Cook the Cauliflower:**
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the cauliflower florets and cook until tender, about 8-10 minutes. Drain well.

3. **Blend the Purée:**
   - In a blender or food processor, combine the cooked cauliflower, saffron-infused cream, butter, orange zest, and juice. Blend until smooth. Season with salt and white pepper to taste.
   
4. **Keep Warm:**
   - Transfer the purée to a saucepan and cover to keep warm until serving.

#### Scallops
1. **Prepare the Scallops:**
   - Pat the scallops dry and season with salt and white pepper on both sides.

2. **Sear the Scallops:**
   - Heat the unsalted butter and olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the butter begins to foam, place the scallops in the skillet, ensuring they’re not overcrowded.
   
3. **Cook the Scallops:**
   - Sear the scallops without moving them, allowing them to form a deep golden crust, approximately 2-3 minutes per side.
   
4. **Finish with Citrus:**
   - Just before removing them from the pan, sprinkle the orange zest over the scallops, tossing gently to combine the flavors.

#### Plating
1. **Plate the Purée:**
   - Spoon a generous portion of the saffron and orange-infused cauliflower purée onto the center of each pre-warmed serving plate.

2. **Arrange the Scallops:**
   - Place three scallops atop the purée on each plate. Garnish with fresh chervil leaves.

3. **Serve Immediately:**
   - Pair with a chilled glass of Vermentino di Sardegna Cantina del Vermentino Funtanaliras 2020 for a perfect complement to the dish.

Enjoy the delicate flavors of the sea with the citrusy brightness and gentle saffron aroma in this elegant appetizer. Bon Appétit!
