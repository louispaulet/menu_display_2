        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Our project is at the intersection of technology and gastronomy. Using the advanced capabilities of <strong>GPT-4</strong>, we generate fictional yet captivating menus in JSON format, each one meticulously designed to reflect the culinary vision of an imagined chef and restaurant.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          These menus aren't just lists of dishes‚Äîthey tell stories. Each menu features a chef, a restaurant name and location, and a carefully calculated total price, along with the price per dish, offering a complete dining experience. This allows us to explore and showcase the limitless possibilities of AI in the culinary world.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          To bring these AI-generated menus to life, we use the <strong>FLUX-DEV-1</strong> image generation model to create stunning visuals of each dish. These images capture the essence of the fictional dishes, making the menus not just a digital text but a feast for the eyes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The visual component is crucial in our project, as it allows us to demonstrate how AI can push the boundaries of creativity, even in areas traditionally dominated by human artistry. Through this project, we aim to inspire both food enthusiasts and tech innovators.
